/**
 * This interface is intended for use cases where sorting elements and computing an "is affected" information are
 * combined. The combination might be reasonable since both of these computations might rely on similar data which would
 * be cached for performance reasons. Also, the sorting is cached for later re-use.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface return sorted {@link IOrderIterator}s. The idea is that an iterator iterates over
 * the cached and filtered sorted set of elements. The filtering is done by enabling elements to be visited during the
 * iteration. As a {@link IOrderIterator}'s default, all elements are disabled.
