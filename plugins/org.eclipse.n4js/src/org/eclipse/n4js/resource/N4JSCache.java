	 * The given {@link CancelIndicator} contributes to responsiveness, but only on cache miss. In detail:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>a caller usually performs several calls targeting this method</li>
	 * <li>of all those calls, only the first one (for a given resource) causes validations to run</li>
	 * <li>all subsequent calls (for that resource) result in cache-hit</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Concurrency usage note: the same instance of this class is intentionally reused from the Outline view (via
	 * {@code ImageDescriptionHelper}) and from the transpiler (via {@code AbstractSubGenerator}). That instance has
	 * additional clients but the focus are invokers of this method. To start, the class is not thread-safe. However for
	 * the sharing just described (between Outline and transpiler) making this method synchronized is enough.
	 * <p>
	 * Other threads besides those for outline view and transpiler could in principle access the cache. However that's a
	 * situation that's pre-existent to the just described sharing between outline and transpiler.
