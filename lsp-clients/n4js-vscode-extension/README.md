# VSCode LSP extension for N4JS

This extension adds language support for [N4JS](https://www.eclipse.org/n4js/) to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the Language Server Protocol ([LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)).


## N4JS

N4JS is a general-purpose programming language based on ECMAScript with several additional features.
It adds a static type system as reliable as that of Java, but with the flexibility of JavaScript.
The language provides built-in support for state-of-the-art programming paradigms such as dependency injection and test support.
For more information about N4JS, please refer to the official [project home](https://www.eclipse.org/n4js/).
