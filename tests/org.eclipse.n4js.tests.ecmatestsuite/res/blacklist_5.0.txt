# The following tests are ignored by the pure parser test, 
# as they are expected to fail during execution only.
#
# That is, these tests fail if not run with an execution engine
# as they do not fail (as expected): They are syntactically correct.
# E.g., some files contain illegal code in eval functions, which is
# interpreted as string by the parser.
