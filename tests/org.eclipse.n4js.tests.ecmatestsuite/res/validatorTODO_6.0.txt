# The following tests are ignored by the pure parser test, 
# as they need the validator to check for some constraints not 
# modeled in the grammar. The validation is not completely implemented, though. Thus,
# these tests are ignored at the moment similar to other blacklist entries.
#

# Math object is NOT constructor

# The global object does not have a Construct property

# The global object does not have a Call property
