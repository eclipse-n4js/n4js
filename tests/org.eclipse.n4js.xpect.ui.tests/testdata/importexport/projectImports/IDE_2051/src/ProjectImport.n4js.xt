// XPECT noerrors -->
import * as N from "IDE_2051_b"

// XPECT noerrors -->
import {Other} from "IDE_2051_b/some/deep/path/Other"


// Note that the second import above tests two things at once:
// 1) basic functionality of import with complete module specifiers
// 2) priority of import via complete module specifier over import via plain module specifier (without project ID)
//
// ad 2: the idea of this test is that the above string "IDE_2051_b/some/deep/path/Other" can be interpreted both as
// a valid complete module specifier (then pointing to some/deep/path/Other in project IDE_2051_b) and as a valid plain
// module specifier (then pointing to module IDE_2051_b/some/deep/path/Other in project IDE_2051_clash; note that
// project IDE_2051_clash has a folder called IDE_2051_b!!)
//
// This test makes sure that the first option has priority (i.e. interpreting the string as complete module specifier)
