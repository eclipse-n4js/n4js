//actually two MainModules are found, one in A, other in B
//since calling project does not have "Main" first one found wins (ambiguity is not the resolved by using project import, or preficing module with project id)
//TODO it would be nice to have validation giving a warning saying project import should be used for MainModules
// XPECT noerrors --> resolves to first found, e.g. A/Main
import * as SpaceMain from "Main"

console.log("\nA" + SpaceMain)
