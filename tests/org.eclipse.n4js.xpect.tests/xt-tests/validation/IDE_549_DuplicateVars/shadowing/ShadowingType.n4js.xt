// N4JSSpec, subsection{Duplicates and Shadowing}
// Function declarations may shadow type declarations. However, both entities are to be handled completely differently, so that error will occur if the shadowing is ignored by the programmer anyway.


//--- type shadowing allowed

class A{};

function fd1(){
	// XPECT warnings --> "Variable names should start with lower case letter." at "A"
	var A;
}

//... but not in catch variable as we don't allwo shadowing there

function fd2(){
	try{
		throw 2;
		/* XPECT errors ---
			"Catch variable A shadows class A (line 22)." at "A"
		---
		// XPECT warnings ---
			"Catch variable names should start with lower case letter." at "A"
		--- */
		} catch (A){
			console.log(A);// output- > 2
		}
	}

// ... and no duplication
