// tests cases in which the optional field is ignored (i.e. the standard case), because we do not have one of the
// special cases of subtype checks with optional field semantics:


class C {
	public f?: string;
}
class D {}

function foo(p: ~~C) {}


let ol = {};
// XPECT errors --> "~Object is not a structural subtype of ~~C: missing field f." at "ol"

// XPECT errors --> "~Object is not a structural subtype of ~~C: missing field f." at "ol"

// XPECT errors --> "D is not a structural subtype of ~~C: missing field f." at "d"
