/*
 * This shows that validation for duplicate names when N4Type is involved is suppressed.
 * ASTStructureValidator is adding error on "arguments" usage.
 * TODO : Remove that check from mentioned utility. This change may require extra work with ecma test suite.
 * After utility is reworked, unblock duplicate names validation to do this check
 * Do those chaneg separately.
