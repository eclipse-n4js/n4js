# This folder contains test cases targeting the formatter.



## Problematic cases

### Autowrap in lines above the currently formatted line.
Auto-Wrapping is currently behaving strange in some ways.
*  In file  [x_annoations....](x_annotations_long_wrapping_problem.n4js.xt) one test is marked with a FIXME.

    It wraps in the wrong position.

	The warp is inserted in front of the "extends" keyword. But the auto-wrap should not be triggered in that line. The actual trigger is
	in the line with the very long @Description annotation.

*  In file [autowrap.n4js.xt](autowrap.n4js.xt) the first two tests (also marked as FIXMEs) show a double-auto-wrap behavior, where a long line is split into three instead of two lines.


*  In file [wishes01Before.n4js.xt](wishes01Before.n4js.xt) there is a single huge test (currently with FIXME) showing the expectation

*  In file [expressions2.n4js.xt](expressions2.n4js.xt) there is a FIXME disable the first of two tests. NOTE if the second test is completely removed from the file, the first test
	passes. --> first test is affected by the following lines of code not under test.

### Oscillation with autorapping
*  In file [rev2_oscillation.n4js.xt](rev2_oscillation.n4js.xt) oscillation is showing, giving 1 or 4 lines for the same statement. First test passes and gives expected result. Second test uses the result of the first step (copied by hand) and applies formatting --> collapses the text into a single line again. It should have stayed as is. FIXME

*  In file [rev2_oscillation_with_variables.n4js.xt](rev2_oscillation_with_variables.n4js.xt) oscillation is showing, moving one expression up and down.

### InsertSemi is behaving strangely:

* In file [rev_short_param_in_call_01.n4js.xt](rev_short_param_in_call_01.n4js.xt) the test case demonstrates that an empty line is swallowed:
  Formatting states ```newLines(1,1,2)``` for all top-level elements.
  If the input is missing a semicolon followed by an empty line before the following statement, the empty line is removed.
  If the semicolon is explicitly given, the empty line remains as intended.


* File [rev_long_param_in_call_01.n4js.xt](rev_long_param_in_call_01.n4js.xt) shows the same ASI-error as above PLUS an alternation with Auto-Wrapping

### Top level indentation
* File [rev_classes_01.n4js.xt](rev_classes_01.n4js.xt) 4 out of 7 tests fail:
  Indentation for top-level class declarations & function declaration is not computed properly -- maybe an issue with XPect framework since the same data works fine in an editor.
