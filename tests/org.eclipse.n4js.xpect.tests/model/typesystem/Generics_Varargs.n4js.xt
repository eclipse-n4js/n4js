// consistency between vararg and several plain fpars w.r.t. generics and inference:

class A {
	static <T> mSimple(arg1 : T, arg2 : T, arg3 : T) : T { return null; }
	static <T> mVararg(...args : T) : T { return null; }
}

// the following two cases should work consistently:
var a1 : union{number,string} = A.mSimple(42,"hello",21);
var a2 : union{number,string} = A.mVararg(42,"hello",21);	// did not work before bug fix
