// NOTE: as of September 2019 this has changed; we no longer use functions $implements/$instanceof
//       but instead use the ES6 Symbol.hasInstance on interfaces. Therefore, the following was deactivated:
/*
// to assert that the proper built-in function is called for instance below, we change them as follows:
var global = new Function('return this;')() as Object;
global['$implements'] = function() {
	console.log('$implements was called!')
}
global['$instanceof'] = function() {
	console.log('$instanceof was called!')
}
