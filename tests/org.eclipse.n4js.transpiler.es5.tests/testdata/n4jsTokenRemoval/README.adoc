In this folder we have (very) high level tests for the compiler.
Main purpose is to see if n4js specific tokens are removed from code or if no strange constructs were introduced during compile time.
Basically check if compiled code can be executed without SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError.

Those are not checking if concrete features behave correctly.
