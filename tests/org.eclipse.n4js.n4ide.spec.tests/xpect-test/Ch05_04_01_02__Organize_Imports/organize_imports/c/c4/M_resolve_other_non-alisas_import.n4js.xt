/* NOT APPLICABLE RIGHT NOW:
   As Discussed btw Mark-Oliver & Torsten, the B down there right now is resolve with
   an error state to the same B as used by the alias.
   To change this behaviour it would be conscice not link B at all. Then the resololution
   with organize imports comes out of the box.
