// case #3: not really related to original problem of GH-72, but make sure the fix does not break the following code

// XPECT noerrors -->
let foo2: (boolean)=>string = function foo2(t) { return t ? foo2(false) : ""; };


// case #4: same as with #3

function foo1(t: boolean): string {
	// XPECT noerrors -->
