// the error message is a bit misleading, but having an error here should definitely be correct
// (because we have to pick a concrete type for the fpar in the function expression that is the

// compare with this similar but simpler case:

function <T> foo2(p1 : G<T>, p2 : G<T>) {}

// XPECT errors ---
// "G<?> is not a subtype of G<any>." at "g1"
// "G<?> is not a subtype of G<any>." at "g2"
// ---
