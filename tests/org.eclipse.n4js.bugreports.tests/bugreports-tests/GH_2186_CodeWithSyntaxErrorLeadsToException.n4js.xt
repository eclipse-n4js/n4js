/* XPECT_SETUP org.eclipse.n4js.bugreports.tests.N4JSBugreportTest END_SETUP */


// 1) Before the bug fix, the below code threw exceptions.
// 2) With only the first step of the bug fix, the below code produced a bogus error "<null> is not a subtype of any."
// at offset 0 with length 0, causing VSCode to behave oddly as described in the comment of the GitHub issue (i.e. it
// did no longer update issue markers in the file's editor).


class G<T> {}
new G<

// XPECT errors --> "no viable alternative at input ';'" at ";"
;

// XPECT errors --> "int is not a subtype of string." at "42"
let x: string = 42;
