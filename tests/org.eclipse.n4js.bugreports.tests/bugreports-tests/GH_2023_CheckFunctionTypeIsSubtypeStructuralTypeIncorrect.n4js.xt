let fn: (string)=>boolean;


// 1) from bug report:

let obj: ~Object with { prop: string };
// XPECT errors --> "Function is not a structural subtype of ~Object with { prop: string }: missing structural field prop." at "fn"
obj = fn;


// 2) but this should work, because function objects have a getter called "length":

let objWithLength: ~Object with { get length(): number }
// XPECT noerrors -->
objWithLength = fn;
