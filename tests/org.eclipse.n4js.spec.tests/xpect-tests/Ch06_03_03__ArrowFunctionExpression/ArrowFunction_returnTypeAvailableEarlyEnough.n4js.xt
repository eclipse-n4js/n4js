//
// NOTE: this is an important test! It ensures that the type of the single-expression arrow function in its tweaked
// version (see ArrowFunctionProcessor#tweakArrowFunctions()) is available already during AST traversal, immediately
// after processing the arrow function node. This is ensure below by checking the type of variable 'v01', which is
// inferred during AST traversal immediately after processing the AST node representing the single-expression arrow
// function.

function bar():void {}

// XPECT type of 'a=>bar()' --> {function(any):void}
let v01 = a=>bar();

// XPECT type of 'v01' --> {function(any):void}
v01; // before the fixes of GH-490 the type of v01 was {function(any):any}
