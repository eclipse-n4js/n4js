// its containing type is not directly accessible from the file containing the 'super' keyword
//
// two sub-cases:
// 1) getter/setter defined in a super class
// 2) getter/setter defined (with body) in an interface and consumed by a super class
//
// NOTE: sub-case 2) does *not* apply to the static case tested in this file. However, this might
//       be changed by IDE-1453, and then this test should be aligned to the one for the non-static
