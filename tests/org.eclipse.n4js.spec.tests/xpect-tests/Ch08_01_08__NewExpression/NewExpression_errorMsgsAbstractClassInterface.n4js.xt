abstract class C {}

interface I {}


// customized error messages for instantiation of abstract classes and interfaces:

// XPECT errors --> "Cannot instantiate abstract class C." at "C"
new C();
// XPECT errors --> "Cannot instantiate interface I." at "I"
new I();


// but if the type of the classifier is not directly given, we want to see the generic error message:

let typeC: type{C};
let typeI: type{I};

// XPECT errors --> "Cannot instantiate type{C}." at "typeC"
new typeC();
// XPECT errors --> "Cannot instantiate type{I}." at "typeI"
new typeI();
