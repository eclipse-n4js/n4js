// \begin{constraints}[Consuming Roles]\label{cnstr:Consuming_Roles}

//part 1 - Consumer must be a Role or Class

interface R1 {
}

interface R2{
}


interface R3{
}

class ConsumerC implements R1,R2,R3{}
interface ConsmerR extends R1,R2,R3{}

//check below is failing so hard, that it had to be moced to separate file <RoleCOnsumedByInterface>
//otherwise it was messing up all other xpect checks in this file
//interface ConsumerI extends R1,R2,R3{}


//part 3 - Consumed interfaces must be accessible for consumer
// since we don't have nested classes, all interfaces in the same module are visible
// visibility across modules should be dealt with import statements,
// so no special test for interfaces visibility.



//part 4 - Role cannot be consumed multiple times
// XPECT errors --> "Cannot consume Ch05_01_04__Generic_Classifiers/AT_168_RoleConsumer/R1 multiple times." at "R1"
class Cr1r1 implements R1, R1 {}


// XPECT errors --> "Cannot consume Ch05_01_04__Generic_Classifiers/AT_168_RoleConsumer/R3 multiple times." at "R3"
interface Rr3r3 extends R3, R3 {}

interface RoleWithR1 extends R1{}

//this is ok, as interface (e.g. R1) can be consumed multiple times
class CwithMultiR1 implements R1, RoleWithR1 {}


// part 5 - bound parameters
