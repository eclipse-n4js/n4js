// NOTE: this test covers two cases that are a challenge for the resolution of computed property names
// (both boil down to making sure that having only a type reference to a container type (i.e. Cls1, Cls2) triggers
// resolution of its members' computed names)


class A {}

// CASE #1

function fun1(p: Cls1) {
	// XPECT noerrors --> "Couldn't resolve reference to IdentifiableElement 'field'." at "field"

}

class Cls1 {
	['field']: A;

// CASE #2
