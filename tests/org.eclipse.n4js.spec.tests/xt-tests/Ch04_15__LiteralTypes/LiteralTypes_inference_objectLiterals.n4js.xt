// inferred to type 'int' instead of '42')

// ~Object with { prop1: "hello"; prop2: "BAD!" } is not a structural subtype of ~Object with { prop1: string; prop2: number }: prop1 failed: "hello" is not equal to string and 1 more problems.

// XPECT errors --> "~Object with { prop1: string; prop2: string } is not a structural subtype of ~Object with { prop1: string; prop2: number }: prop2 failed: string is not equal to number." at "{ prop1: "hello", prop2: "BAD!" }"
