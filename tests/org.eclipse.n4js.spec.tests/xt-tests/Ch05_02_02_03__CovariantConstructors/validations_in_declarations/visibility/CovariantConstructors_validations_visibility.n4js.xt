/*
   NOTE: the idea of this test file is to ensure that visibility checking of member overrides is NOT applied to ordinary
   constructors (class D) and correctly applied to covariant constructors (class D_cc).
   In these cases, we will always have the two errors "Cannot extend class ..." and we could therefore omit the error
   on class D_cc's constructor as a unnecessary duplicate error. However, for consistency with handling of overrides of
   ordinary members, it is deemed more understandable to show this additional, slightly redundant error.
