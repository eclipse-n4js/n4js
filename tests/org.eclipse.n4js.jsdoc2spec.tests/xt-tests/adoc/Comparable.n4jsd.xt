	   ==== Description

	   Returns ``++true++`` if the arguments are equal to each other and ``++false++`` otherwise.
	   This method is compares ``++var x:~i~C[]; *cc*; _sdnf = _dfd_ads*_xy*i; f();++`` and ``++undefined++`` using type coercion rules i.e.
	   ``++null++`` and ``++undefined++`` are treated loosely equal to each other.

	   If the arguments do not implement the Comparable interface, they are compared via a "deep equals" using
	   loose equality rules.

	   Otherwise, equality is determined by using the ``++Comparable#equals++`` method of the first argument.
