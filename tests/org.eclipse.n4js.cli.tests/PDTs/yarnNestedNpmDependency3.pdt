# Project Discovery Test
# working dir marked with '*'

# Projects in the global node_modules folder of a yarn workspace root project have priority over
# projects in local node_modules folders. Note that this is at odds with node's module look-up,
# but is necessary because N4JS does not yet support multiple projects with the same name.
