# Project Discovery Test
# working dir marked with '*'

# The optimization of not discovering PLAINJS project applies not only to projects in the node_modules folder,
# but also to top-level projects (i.e. project in side-by-side use case). Therefore, P1 is not discovered.
#
# Because dependencies are not possible between side-by-side projects, also P2 is not discovered even though
# there is a dependency from N4JS project P3 to P2.

FOLDERS
-*SomeFolder
-- P1 [PROJECT plainJS]
-- P2 [PROJECT plainJS]
-- P3 [PROJECT dependencies={"P2":"*"}]

EXPECT
- SomeFolder/P3
