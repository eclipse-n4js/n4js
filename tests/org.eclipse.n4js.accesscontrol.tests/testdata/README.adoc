The file 'Matrix.xlsx' specifies test scenarios and expectations for N4JS's access control modifier test cases.
The following two files are deviated from it.
- The file 'Matrix.csv' is used for a generator that generates and executes test cases and expects the specified verdicts.
- The file 'Matrix.pdf' is simply a PDF rendition of the original table.

Please see the JavaDoc of class AccessControlTest for more information about the intent and the format of these files.
For an explanation of the different test expectations (y, n, u, y?, n?, u?, #), please see the JavaDoc of class
Expectation.
