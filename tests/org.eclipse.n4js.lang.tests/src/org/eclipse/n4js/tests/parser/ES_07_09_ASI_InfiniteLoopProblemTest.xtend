	 * In some cases, the ASI rewinds the input when an EOL is found and inserts a semicolon there.
	 * In this test, this
	 * happens after "a.field1". However, somehow the parse tries to parse members of the
	 * class expression B. This is completely wrong at this position, I'm not quite sure
	 * how this happens. Anyway, the recover leads to an infinite loop, since inserting
	 * a semicolon after "a.field1" does not solve the real problem -- so the parser
	 * again finds a problem and tries to recover at the same position.
	 * In order to prevent this to happen, org.eclipse.n4js.parser.SemicolonInjectionHelper.Callback.allowASI(RecognitionException)
	 * stores the last state in which an EOL has been interpreted as semicolon, and when we
	 * try to do this again, we break the cycle. Although this works, we should
	 * solve the problem at its cause and not prevent some symptom. The only problem: What is the real cause?
