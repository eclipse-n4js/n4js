= Conversions and Reflection

[.language-n4js]
== Autoboxing and Coercing

Coercing is the ability to implicitly cast one (primitive) type to another.
Autoboxing is a special kind of coercing in that is the ability to automatically convert a primitive value type, such as `string`, `number`, or `boolean`,
to its corresponding Object type version `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`.
The capital letters in the latter are an essential distinction.

Conversion between primitives and object-representations of a datatype are not automatic in N4JS. Only in the cases of object-method invocations on a primitive type
(for `string` to call `"abc".length`, for example) automatic conversion is applied.

Note that N4JS specific primitive types `pathselector` and `i18nkey` are handled similarly to `string`.

=== Coercing


In cite:[ECMA11a], coercing is defined by means of the abstract specification method `ToPrimitive` cite:[ECMA11a(S9.1)], also see cite:[ECMA11a(S9.10)]).
Other conversions, such as `ToNumber`, are not directly supported but reflected in the typing rules of expressions.

We express absence of automatic coercion here by means of subtype
relations:

[math]
++++
\beginalign
\infer{\tee \type{Boolean} \notsubtype{\type{boolean}}}{} \spc \infer{\tee \type{boolean} \notsubtype{\type{Boolean}}}{} \\
\infer{\tee \type{Number} \notsubtype{\type{number}}}{} \spc \infer{\tee \type{number} \notsubtype{\type{Number}}}{}  \\
\infer{\tee \type{String} \notsubtype{\type{string}}}{} \spc \infer{\tee \type{string} \notsubtype{\type{String}}}{}
\endalign
++++

and for the N4JS specific types:

[%hardbreaks]
$\infer{\tee \type{pathSelector}< \type{T}>\subtype{\type{string}}}{} $
$\infer{\tee \type{i18nKey} \subtype{\type{string}}}{}$

If a conversion between primitive and object type is desired, we require the user of N4JS to actively convert the values.
The reason for that is the notably different behavior of object- and primitive-variants of a type in expression evaluation:

[source,n4js]
----
var bool: boolean = false;
var Bool: Boolean = new Boolean( false );

console.log( bool ? "true" : "false"); // prints "false"
console.log( Bool ? "true" : "false"); // prints "true"!
----

Conversion between a primitive type to its object-variant is achieved by the `new` operator.
The `valueOf()` method converts the object-variant back to a primitive value.

[source,n4js]
----
// objects from literals:
var bo: Boolean = new Boolean( true ); // typeof bo: object
var no: Number = new Number( 42 ); // typeof no: object
var so: String = new String( "foo" ); // typeof so: object

// to primitive
var b: boolean = bo.valueOf(); // typeof b: boolean -- true
var n: number = no.valueOf(); // typeof n: number -- 42
var s: string = so.valueOf(); // typeof s: string -- "foo"

// to object-type
bo = new Boolean( b );
no = new Number( n );
so = new String( s );
----

Conversion of variables of type `Object` or from one primitive type to another is expressed in terms of typing rules for expressions.
That is, it is not possible to convert any `Object` to a primitive in general, but it is possible to do so in the context of certain expressions such as additive operator.
The applied conversions are described in <<_auto-conversion-of-class-instances>>

=== Autoboxing of Primitives


In cite:[ECMA11a], autoboxing is defined by `ToObject` cite:[ECMA11a(S9.9)].

Autoboxing is not directly supported in N4JS. Instead, primitive types virtually have the same members as their corresponding object types.
It is then possible to use the Autoboxing feature when calling a member.
In general, Autoboxing is only supported for accessing built-in read-only (immutable) properties.
For example, `"some string value".split(" ");` is supported but `"some string value".foo=1;` will be rejected as String does not allow properties to be added (cf. `String` vs. `String+`, see <<_dynamic>>).

Autoboxing often leads to problems, in particular in combination with dynamic types â€“ this is why it is not directly supported in N4JS.

[source,n4js]
----
var s: String+ = "Hello"; // <1>

s.prop = 1;
console.log(s.prop); // <2>
----
<1> will produce an error to prevent the following scenario:
<2> prints "undefined"
// todo[wk: restrict coercing]{\url{http://restrictmode.org/} describes some restrictions on operators with regards to coercing and common bugs, we should consider implementing some of these restrictions as well. Also see chapter type inference}

=== Autoboxing of Function Expressions and Declarations



Function expressions and declarations always define an object of type `Function`, thus coercing or Autoboxing is not required in case of functions:

It is always possible to use a function expression where a `Function` is required, and to use an object of type `Function` where a function expression is expected.
This is only possible if the function signatures are subtype-compatible, see <<_function-type>> for details.

Still, it is always possible to call members of `Function`, e.g., `function(){}.length()`.

[.language-n4js]
== Auto-Conversion of Objects

=== Auto-Conversion of Class Instances


All classes defined in N4JS modules implicitly subclass `N4Object`, which is a plain JavaScript Object type.
The same auto-conversion rules defined for JavaScript `Object` therefore apply to `N4Object` instances as well.

The basic conversion uses the abstract JavaScript function `ToPrimitive` cite:[ECMA11a(S9.1)], which relays on the specification method `Object` cite:[ECMA11a(S8.12.8)].
`DefaultValue` calls `valueOf` or `toString` methods if they are defined by the class (in the `methods`-builder).

Note that according to the cite:[ECMA11a], in most cases, objects are first converted into primitives.
That is, in most cases, no extra hint is passed to `DefaultValue`. Thus `valueOf` usually takes precedence over toString as demonstrated in the following example:

.Auto-Conversion
[example]
--

Assume some classes and corresponding instances defined as follows:

[source,n4js]
----
class A {}
class B{
    @Override public toString(): string { return "MyB"}
}
class C{
    @Override public valueOf(): any { return 10}
}
class D{
    @Override public toString(): string { return "MyD"}
    @Override public valueOf(): any { return 20}
}
var a = new A(), b = new B(), c = new C(), d = new D();
----

Instances of these classes will be converted as demonstrated as follows:

[source,n4js]
----
console.log(a+"");                      // [object Object]
console.log(a+1);                       // [object Object]1

console.log(""+b+"");                   // MyB
console.log(1+b+1);                     // 1MyB1

console.log(c+"");                      // 10
console.log(c+1);                       // 11

console.log(d+"");                      // 20
console.log(d+1);                       // 21
----
--


==== Auto-Conversion of Interface Instances

Instances of interfaces actually are instances of classes at runtime.
The auto-conversion rules described in <<_auto-conversion-of-class-instances>> are applied to instances declared as instances of interfaces as well.

=== Auto-Conversion of Enum Literals

Enumeration values are objects and thus follow the behavior for ECMAScript `Object` and `Function`.
They have a custom $toString$ method which returns the name of the enumeration value.

[.language-n4js]
== Type Cast and Type Check

=== Type Cast

  (IDEBUG-56): Casting to TypeVars


Type casts are expressed with the cast expression (`as`), see <<_cast-as-expression>> for details.

We first define helper rules for the type cast constraints as follows:

[math]
++++
\beginalign
\infer{isCPOE(T)}{\mu(T) \in \{ \type{TEnum}, \type{Class}, \type{Primitive}, \type{ObjectType}\}}\\
\infer{isCPOE(T)}{\mu{T} \in\{\type{ClassifierType}, \type{TypeType} \} \land \mu(T.typeRef) \neq \type{TypeVariable} }\\
\infer{isInterface(T)}{\mu(T) \in \{ \type{Interface} \}}\\
\infer{isBoundTypeVar(T)}{\mu(T)=\type{TypeVariable}  \land T.upperBounds \neq  \emptyset }\\
\infer{isFinalByType(T)}{\mu(T) \in \{\ \type{TEnum}, \type{Primitive} \} \lor (\mu(T)=\type{Class} \land T.extensibility=\lenum{final} \})}
\endalign
++++

.Cast Validation At Compile Time
[req,id=IDE-89,version=1]
--
Given a type cast expression `e` in which
$\tee e.expr: S$ and and target type `T`, the
following constraints must hold:

1.  `T` must be a classifier, enum, primitive, function type expression, classifier type, type variable, union or intersection type:
+
[%hardbreaks]
$\mu(T) \in \spc \{ \type{any}, \type{Class}, \type{Interface}, \type{Enum}, \type{Primitive}, \type{ObjectType}, $
$\spc \type{FunctionTypeExpression}, \type{ClassifierType}, \type{TypeVariable}, \type{Union}, \type{Intersection} \} $
2. if `S` is a subtype of `T`, the cast is unnecessary and a warning will be generated.
3. if `S` and `T` are classes, enums or primitive types, then `T` must be a subtype of `S`.
This is also true if `T` is an interface and the type of `S` cannot have subtypes, or vice versa.
+
[%hardbreaks]
$(isCPOE(T) $
$ \hspace{2em}\land (isCPOE(S) $
$ \hspace{4em}\lor (\mu(S)=\type{Intersection} \land \exists S' \in S: isCPOE(S'))) $
$ \lor (isInterface(T)  \land isFinalByType(S) ) $
$ \lor (isFinalByType(T) \land isInterface(S) )  ) \rightarrow \tee T <: S $
// Doesn't work for daimond-relationships with S and T on left and right. --> limit to classes only.
4. if `S` is a class, enum or primitive type and `T` is a type-variable, then for each given boundary $T^{up}_i$ of `T`
of type class, enum or primitive `S` must be a member of the type hierarchy: footnote:[`i` iterates over all boundaries]
+
[%hardbreaks]
$(isBoundTypeVar(T) \land isCPOE(S) ) $
$ \rightarrow  \forall_{T^{up}_i \in T.upperBounds} (isCPOE({T^{up}_i}) \rightarrow \tee ( {T^{up}_i} <: S \lor  {T^{up}_i} :> S ) ) $
5. if `S` is a union or intersection type, then the type cast is valid if it is valid for at least one element of `S`.
6. if `S` and `T` are generics, and if $S^0=T^0$,
a cast is possible if type arguments are sub- or supertypes of each other: footnote:[`i` iterates over all type args]
+
[%hardbreaks]
$\mu(S)=\type{Classifier} \land \mu(T)=\type{Classifier} \land S^0=T^0 \rightarrow $
$\hspace{2em} (\forall\ S.typeArg_i <: T.typeArg_i) \lor (\forall\ T.typeArg_i <: S.typeArg_i)$
7.  If `T` is a union type, then the type cast is valid if it is valid for at least one element of `T`.
8.  If `T` is an intersection type, then the type cast is valid if it is valid for all elements of `T`.

NOTE: `any` is a supertype of all other types, thus it is always possible to cast a variable of type `any` to other (non-composed) types.

--

// TODO: Review content from old LaTeX spec below and decide if still useful.

//todo{In Java, there are more illegal cases: " if there exists a supertype X of T, and a supertype Y of S, such that both X and Y are provably distinct parameterized types, and that the erasures of X and Y are the same, a compile time error occurs"}

%\lstnfjs{N4Object} instances can be casted using the global function \lstnfjs{cast}. This function is declared as follows:

=== Type Check


There are basically two ways of testing the type of a variable: `typeof` and `instanceof`.
N4JS supports type comparison via the ECMAScript `instanceof` operator.
The operator `instanceof` retains its standard ECMAScript behavior (e.g. checking whether a value is an instance of a constructor function), but has additional functionality when used with N4JS types.

When used with an N4JS class, `instanceof` also supports checking against an interface. For N4JS enumeration values, it can be used to check whether the value is part of a specific enumeration.

`typeof` only returns a string with the name of the ECMAScript type, which is `Object` for all class instances.


N4JS specific `string` types, that is `pathSelector` and `i18nkey` cannot be tested during runtime.
These types, therefore, must not be used in `instanceof` expressions.
The same is true for string-based enums and arrays which cannot be tested during runtime, thus string-based enum and array types are not permitted on the right-hand side of `instancesof` constructs.
For all types for which the evaluation result of `instanceof` could be computed at compile time, the check is unnecessary and thus it is refused by the compiler.
Using structural types on the right-hand side of `instancesof` constructs is also not permitted.

In order to avoid errors at runtime, the `instanceof` operator defines appropriate constraints, see <<_relational-expression>> for details.

.Type Check Example
[example]
--

Given the following classes and variable:

[source,n4js]
----
interface I{}
class S{}
class Sub extends S implements I{}

var x = new Sub();
----

--

`typeof x` will simply return `object`. The following table shows the difference between plain JavaScript `instanceof` and N4JSâ€™s `instanceof`:


[cols="<m,^m,^m"]
|===
|Check | JavaScript | N4JS

| x instanceof Sub| true | true
| x instanceof S  | true | true
| x instanceof I  | false   | true

[.language-n4js]
== Reflection meta-information


All N4JS classes, interfaces and enumerations provide meta-information
that is used by the runtime and standard library.
//% All reflection (meta) classes are described in <<N4JSObjects>>, an overview is provided in {fig:cd_reflectionModel}.
All classifiers (including enums) provide meta-information by means of a static getter `n4class`.
Since it is static getter, it is actually an instance getter of the
constructor (or classifier) of a type, which is the only way to retrieve
that information in case of interfaces. For enums, this can be retrieved
from instances as well.

This getter is of type `N4Class` which is a built-in type just like `N4Object`. It contains the following members:


`fqn` ::
The $FQN$ of the type.

`n4superType` ::
The `N4Class` of the supertype, may be null if supertype is a not an `N4Class`.

`allImplementedInterfaces` ::
List of The $FQN$ of implemented interfaces (transitively
but without interfaces implemented by supertype)

`get isClass` ::
True if the type is an N4Class.

`get isInterface` ::
True if the type is an N4Interface.


=== Reflection for Classes

The meta-information for classes is available by means of `N4Object`â€™s static
getter `n4class`. Since it is static getter, it is actually an instance getter of the constructor of a type.

.Reflection with `N4class`
[example]
--

This example demonstrates how these reflective features are accessed:
//% see /org.eclipse.n4js.transpiler.es5.tests/testdata/spec_chap_06_04/Ex57_Reflection_with_N4Class.n4js.xt

[source,n4js]
----
class A {}
class B extends A {}
var b = new B();
console.log(B.n4class.fqn);
console.log(b.constructor.n4class.fqn);
console.log(b.constructor.n4class.n4superType.fqn);
console.log(B.n4class.constructor.n4class.fqn);
----

Assuming this code is defined in file `A`, this will output

[source,n4js]
----
A.B
A.B
A.A
N4Class
----
--

The built-in types `N4Object` and `N4Class` are also accessible.
They are not defined in a module, thus their <<Acronyms,FQN>> returns only their simple name.

.Reflection with Built-In Types
[example]
--


[source,n4js]
----
console.log('N4Object.n4class.fqn:      ' + N4Object.n4class.fqn)
console.log('N4Class.n4class.fqn:       ' + N4Class.n4class.fqn)

class A {}
console.log('A.n4class.fqn:             ' + A.n4class.fqn)
console.log('A.n4class.n4superType.fqn: ' + A.n4class.n4superType.fqn)
----

Assuming this code is defined in file `A`, this will output

[source,n4js]
----
N4Object.n4class.fqn:      N4Object
N4Class.n4class.fqn:       N4Class
A.n4class.fqn:             A.A
A.n4class.n4superType.fqn: N4Object
----

Note that classes extending `Object` do not provide the static `n4class` getter, hat is

[source,n4js]
----
class B extends Object {}
console.log('B.n4class.fqn:             ' + B.n4class.fqn)
----

would issue an error as cannot be resolved.

--

.N4Class.of
[example]
--

The type has a method to retrieve the meta-information from instances (i.e. or enumeration literals using )
without using the constructor.

[source,n4js]
----
class C { }
interface I {}  class IImpl implements I {}
enum E { L }

var c: C = new C();
var i: I = new IImpl();
var e: E = E.L;

console.log(C.n4type.fqn);
console.log(N4Class.of(c).fqn);

console.log(I.n4type.fqn);
console.log(N4Class.of(i).fqn);

console.log(E.n4type.fqn);
console.log(N4EnumType.of(e).fqn);
----

--

=== Reflection for Interfaces



The meta-information of an interface `X` is available via getter `n4class` defined in the `type{X}`.
This field is of type `N4Class` as well.
Since an interface cannot have a super classs, the property `n4superTypes` will always be empty.
Calling `isInterface` respectively on the returned `N4Class` instance will return true.

=== Reflection for Enumerations

[source,n4js]
----
var n: number; var b: boolean; var s: string;
----

The meta-information for enumerations is available by means of the getter `n4class`, either statically by using the enumeration type or (in terms of an instance getter) via a literal.
Calling `isEnum` on the returned `N4Class` instance will return true.

[.language-n4js]
== Conversion of primitive types

Conversion between primitives is given as follows:

[source,n4js]
----
var n: number; var b: boolean; var s: string;
----

[cols="^.^1m,^.^1m,<.^4m,<3m"]
|===
|From |To |Conversion ^|Example

| string  | number  | Number...
a|
[source,n4js]
----
n = Number("42");//42
----

| string  | boolean | N4Primitives.parseBoolean(...)
a|
[source,n4js]
----
 b=N4Primitives.parseBoolean("false");
----
| number  | boolean | Boolean(...)

a|
[source,n4js]
----
b=Boolean(17.5); //true
----
| number  | string  | Number.toString()

a|
[source,n4js]
----
s=42.toString(); //"42"
----
| boolean | number  | N4Primitives.toNumber(...)

a|
[source,n4js]
----
n=N4Primitives.toNumber(true);
----
| boolean | string  | Boolean.toString()

a|
[source,n4js]
----
 s=true.toString();//"true" }
----
|===

Remarks:

1.  ECMAScript doesnâ€™t define explicit conversion from string content.
Implicit handling states all strings with $>0==true$. `N4Primitives.parseBoolean(x)` yields true for `x.trim().toLowerCase().equals("true")`
2.  The call to `Boolean(..)` for the arguments `0`, `-0`, `null`, `false`, `NaN`, `undefined` and `""` evaluate to `false`.
All other values evaluate to `true`.
3.  `Number` has several methods for converting a value to string cite:[ECMA11a(S15.7.4)]: `toExponential()`, to `Fixed()`, `toPrecision()`.
4.  ECMAScript doesnâ€™t define explicit conversion from boolean to number.
Implicit handling states true $\rightarrow$ 1 and false $\rightarrow$ 0, which `N4Primitives.toNumber()` yields.
