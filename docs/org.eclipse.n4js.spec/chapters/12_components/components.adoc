== N4JS Platform Architecture

=== Overview

<<fig-cmpd_components_in_n4js>> shows the N4JS components described in detail in this
chapter.footnote:[Note that this diagram does not necessarily reflect the actual internal implementation but only the external view.]

[[fig-cmpd_components_in_n4js]]
.N4JS Component Overview
image::{find}fig/cmpd_components_in_n4js.svg[align="center"]

The N4JS platform distinguishes several types of components. The
following components can only be created by internal developers:


Runtime Environment::
  Definition of a runtime environment such as ECMAScript 5.
  A Runtime Environment describes the base types provided by the runtime directly which are usually globally available.
  Other components do not directly rely on runtime environments, but on runtime libraries.
Runtime Library::
  Collections of types provided by the runtime.
  These types may be extensions to certain language specifications.
  E.g., the ECMAScript 6 collection classes are already provided by some environments otherwise only supporting ECMAScript 5.
  The collections are defined in terms of a runtime library which can then be provided by these environments.
  Runtime libraries may also contain polyfils to alter types predefined in the environment.
Test Environment::
  Not yet clear. Environments defined for tests.
Test Library::
  Not yet clear. Libraries defined for tests supported by the to enable running tests and viewing test reports directly within the , such as __Mangelhaft__.

// TODO missing annotation here possibly ACRONYM

The following components can be created by external developers:

[[Apps]]
Apps::
  User-written N4JS applications running in a web browser (the reference browser is Chrome).
Processors::
  User-written N4JS processors running on Node.js.
Libraries::
  User-written libraries used by apps, processors or other libraries.

These components are described in detail later.
// TODO where ^^

A component is similar to a single project in the N4JS IDE. Generally, it contains the following:


Package.json File::
  The `package.json` file describing the components, dependencies and metadata.
Resources::
  Resources such as images, N4ML files etc.
Sources::
  Source files of modules - actual N4JS files used in a project.
Compilation::
  Compiled, minified and concatenated versions of the N4JS files and
  other JS files.
Tests::
  Optional test sources and compiled tests.
Source Maps::
  Optional source maps.

Components contain modules. <<fig-component_content>> describes what can be contained in a component.

[.language-n4js]
== Component Types


Different N4JS component types are described in this section.
At compile time and runtime, dependent components have to be available.
This is the responsibility of the user interface (<<AC,IDE>> or <<AC,CLI>>) and described in the <<AC,N4IDE>> specification.

=== Libraries

A library is a user project providing modules with declaration.

=== Runtime Environment and Runtime Libraries
Runtime environments and libraries define globally available elements (types, variables, functions) provided by the JavaScript engine.
Both must contain _only_ definition files (n4jsd) of which all elements are marked as `@ProvidedByRuntime` (<<_runtime-definitions>>) and `@Global` (<<_global-definitions>>).

Other projects may refer to _multiple_ runtime libraries in their `package.json` file via the property <<package-json-requiredRuntimeLibraries>>.

The concrete runtime environment and library are selected by the JavaScript engine.
Deployment and execution scripts must ensure that a component can run on the given engine; the required environments and libraries must all be compatible with the provided environment.
If no runtime environment is specified, a default an ECMAScript 5 runtime is assumed to be present.

Typical runtime environments are ES5 or ES6, typical runtime libraries are DOM or HTML.

In JavaScript, browsers and other execution environments provide built-in objects.
In browsers, for example, the whole DOM is made available via built-in object types.
In this case, even the global object also becomes a different type (in N4JS terms).
Besides execution environments such as browsers or Node.js, libraries also provide functionality by exposing globally available functions.
This is often used to bridge execution environment inconsistencies.
When browser API differences are adapted by a library, this is called a __polyfil__.
Other adaptations, such as enabling ECMSScript 6 object types in ECMAScript 5 environments, are known as __shim__.
Instead of directly supporting these kind of 'hacks', other components specify which runtime environment and libraries they depend on by specifying unique runtime ids.
Possible shims (in case of environments) or polyfils (in case of libraries) are transparently provided by the execution environment and the bootstrap code.



=== Tests
Tests are special projects which contain tests for other projects.

.Test Project
[req,id=IDE-157,version=1]
--

1.  Tests have full access to the tested project including elements with `project` visibility.
2.  Only other test projects can depend on tests project.
In other words, other components must not depend on test components.

In a test project, the tested projects can be specified via `testee`.
--

=== Type Definitions
Projects of type "definition" are special projects which only provide type information for another so-called _implementation project_,  which only provides executable JS files.

Generally, client projects that depend on a given _implementation project_ may additionally declare a dependency on a corresponding type definitions project, in order to integrate type information on the implementation project. 
This is implemented by means of module-level shadowing. 
More specifically, given a client imports a module with module specifier $M$ from the implementation project. 
When resolving the module specifier, $M$ will first be resolved against the implementation project's type definitions and only secondarily against the implementation project. 
As a consequence, type definition projects may only provide partial type information, while the remaining modules of the implementation project remain accessible through dynamic namespace imports.

.Type Definition Project Configuration
[req,id=GH-821002,version=1]
--

For type definition projects, the following constraints must hold true with regard to their project configuration:

1. They must declare their _implementation project_ via the <<package-json-definesPackage>> property in their `package.json` file.
2. They must not declare an output folder.

--

[.language-n4js]
== Component Content


A component is similar to a project in the N4JS IDE. It consists of sources and test sources.
These items are contained in separate folders alongside output folders and settings specified in the `package.json` file.
The `package.json` file serves as the project description file and is stored at the root of the project (see <<package-json>> for details).

For build and production purposes, other files such as `pom.xml` or `.project` files are automatically derived from the `package.json`. 
These files are not to be added manually.



[.language-n4js]
[[package-json, Package.json File]]
== Package.json File

A folder is a "component" if and only if it contains a `package.json` file. Being a component means
that this folder is recognized by all N4JS-related tools but does not necessarily mean the component
contains N4JS code (it could just contain plain Javascript). The main benefit of being a component
in this sense is that this unit of code can be used from N4JS components as a dependency.

For example, a plain npm project containing only plain Javascript can be a component and
can therefore be used as a project dependency of a full-blown N4JS project.

=== Basic Properties

The following standard `package.json` properties are used by N4JS tooling. Unless otherwise
noted, all these properties have the exact same format and meaning as usual in `package.json`
files.

name ::
  Used as the globally unique identifier of the component.
version ::
  The component's version.
[[package-json-dependencies, dependencies]]
dependencies ::
  List of components required at runtime and compile time.
[[package-json-devDependencies, devDependencies]]
devDependencies ::
  List of components required at compile time only.
main ::
  Path relative to the component's root folder, pointing to a `.js` file
  located in a source container (the `.js` file extension is optional,
  i.e. may be omitted). This file then serves as the component's
  default entry point, i.e. project imports pointing to this component from
  other components will import from the file denoted by this property. In
  addition, this property may denote a folder and is then assumed to point
  to a file `index.js` located in that folder. If this property denotes a file
  other than a `.js` file, it will be ignored. In particular, it cannot be
  used for `.n4js` files; in that case, property "mainModule" has to be used
  (see below).

=== N4JS Properties

In addition to the standard properties above, there is a single N4JS-specific
top-level property called "n4js". The value of this property must always be
an object that may have any combination of the following properties:

projectType::
  (string) Must be one of the following strings:
application:::
  An application. See <<Apps>>.
library:::
  A library. See <<Libraries>>.
processor:::
  For processors running server-side on the N4 platform. Not implemented yet.
test:::
  An N4JS project containing tests for one or more other N4JS projects specified
  via property "testedProjects".
api:::
  For N4JS projects that contain only API (in `.n4jsd` files) to be implemented by other,
  so-called implementation projects. See properties "implementationId", "implementedProjects".
runtimeEnvironment:::
  Runtime environments. See <<Runtime Environment Resolution>>.
runtimeLibrary:::
  Runtime libraries. See <<Runtime Environment and Runtime Libraries>>.
validation:::
  A project in which `.n4js` files are only being validated, not transpiled. This is used for projects
  that are implemented in terms of `.js` files but that also provide type information in terms of `.n4jsd` files.
plainjs:::
  A project which only contains `.js` files and no N4JS resources. The contained JS files are only indexed to allow
  for dynamic imports of specific JavaScript modules. Projects of this type are not being transpiled.
vendorId::
  (string) Globally unique identifier for the component's vendor.
  Used for the `@Internal` accessibility modifier.
vendorName::
  (string) Human-readable name of the component's vendor. Used only for informational
  purposes.
output::
  (string) Path relative to the component's root folder, pointing to a folder where
  all output files will be placed. In particular, this is where the N4JS transpiler
  will put the `.js` files created for each `.n4js` file.
sources::
  (object) Defines various sub-folders where sources, etc. are located. All properties
  of the given object must have to following format: the name must be "source", "external",
  or "test"; the value must be an array of strings, with each string defining a
  path relative to the component's root folder, pointing to a folder where
  source files of the corresponding type are located. For example, paths given via name
  "source" tell the N4JS transpiler where to look for `.n4js` source files to be compiled.

moduleFilters::
  (object) Filters for fine-tuning the validator and compiler. A filter is applied to modules
  matching the given module specifier which may contain wildcards, optionally restricted to
  modules defined in a specific source path.
+
All properties of the given object must have the following format: the name must be a valid 
module filter type (see below); the value must be an array of strings, with each string
defining a pattern of files inside one of the source containers for which validation or
module wrapping is to be turned off. Instead of a plain string, the inner array may
contain an object with properties "module" and "sourceContainer" to make this filter apply
to only one of the source containers (instead of all source containers, which is the default).
+
noValidate:::
  Modules matching this filter are not semantically validated.
  That is, they are still syntactically validated.
  If they are contained in source or test source fragments, it must be possible to bind references
  to declarations inside these modules.
  Note that switching off validation for n4js files is disallowed.
noModuleWrap:::
  Files matching this filter are not wrapped into modules and they are not semantically validated.
  Since they are assumed to be wrapped into modules, declarations inside these modules cannot be referenced by n4js code.

.Module Filters
[example]
====
A simple and a source-container-specific module filter in the `n4js` section of a package.json file.
[source,json]
----
"moduleFilters": {
	"noValidate": [
		"abc*",
		{
			"module": "xyz*",
			"sourceContainer": "src/n4js"
		}
	],
	"noModuleWrap": [
		// syntax same as for noValidate above
	]
}
----
====

[[package-json-mainModule, mainModule]]
mainModule::
  (string) A plain module specifier defining the project’s 'main module'.
  If this property is defined, other projects can import from this project using imports where the string following
  keyword `from` states only the project name and not the complete module specifier (see <<import-statement-semantics>>).
  If this property is defined, top-level property `main` will be ignored.

testedProjects::
  (array) List of N4JS components being tested by this project.
  +
Only components of project type "test" may declare this property. Furthermore, the referenced 
projects must all be of the same project type and must not be of type "test" themselves.

[[package-json-implementationId, implementationId]]
implementationId::
(string) If this property is defined, this component is called an "implementation project" and the string value
  provides a unique identifier for the implementation provided in this component. If this is defined, property
  "implementedProjects" must be defined as well. For details, see <<API and Implementation Components>>.
+ 
Only projects of type "application", "processor", "library", "api" or "validation" may declare this property.

[[package-json-implementedProjects, implementedProjects]]
implementedProjects::
  (array) A list of API components (components of type "api") that are implemented by this component. If this 
  is defined, property "implementationId" must be defined as well. For details, see 
  <<API and Implementation Components>>. Only components of type  "application", "processor", "library", "api" 
  or "validation" may declare this property.

[[package-json-requiredRuntimeLibraries, requiredRuntimeLibraries]]
requiredRuntimeLibraries::
(array) The list of required runtime library components that are required for the execution of this
 component. All components but components of type "runtime environment" may declare this property. Each 
 required runtime library must also be specified as a dependency using one of the top-level 
 properties `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.

moduleLoader::
  (string) This property defines what module loaders are supported by the modules in this component. Possible values are the following:
+
n4js:::: 
  (default) The modules in this component can be loaded with SystemJS or with CommonJS.
+
commonjs:::: 
  Modules in this component must be loaded with CommonJS. When these modules are referenced in 
  generated code (i.e. when importing from these modules), the module specifier will be prefixed 
  with `@@cjs/`.
+
node_builtin::::
  Modules in this component represent node built-in modules such as fs or https. When these modules 
  are referenced in generated code (i.e. when importing from these modules), the module specifier will 
  be prefixed with `@node/`.

extendedRuntimeEnvironment::
  (string) The name of the runtime environment project that is extended by this component. Only components of 
  type "runtime environment" may declare this property.

providedRuntimeLibraries::
  (array) The list of runtime library components that are provided by this component. Only components of 
  type "runtime environment" may declare this property.

initModules::
  (array) A list of modules in terms of module specifiers (strings), that are executed when the component 
  is initialized. This property may only be declared by components of type "runtime environment" and "runtime library".
+
These init modules are executed right before the execution of a user-specified module starts. They may be used to initialize
 polyfills or perform other initialization work with regard to the execution environment (e.g. define global properties).

execModule::
  (string) The module specifier of the exec module of a runtime environment. This property may only be declared by components 
  of type "runtime environment" and "runtime library". The exec module of a runtime environment is executed as the entry-point 
  to the execution of a user-specified module. The underlying script must interpret the execution data and trigger the actual
  module execution in the runtime environment.

[[package-json-definesPackage, definesPackage]]
definesPackage::
  (string) The name of the package this component provides type definitions for. Only components of project type "definition" may declare this property.


All properties described above are optional. The following default values apply:

|===
| *Property*  | *Default Value*
| name        | name of the folder containing the `package.json` file
| version     | "0.0.1"
| projectType | "plainjs"
| vendorId    | "vendor.default"
| mainModule  | "index"
| output      | "."
| sources     | a single source-container of type "source" with path "."
|===

All other properties are undefined if not given in the `package.json` file.

=== Constraints

The following constraints apply.

.GeneralConstraints
[req,id=IDE-158,version=1]
--
1.  There must be an output directory specified so the compiler(s) can run.
--

.Paths
[req,id=IDE-159,version=1]
--
Paths Paths are constrained in the following way:

1.  A path cannot appear more than one time within a source fragment type (same applies to paths in the resources section).
2.  A path cannot be used in different source fragment types at same times.
3.  A path can only be declared exclusively in one of the sections Output, Libraries, Resources or Sources.
4.  A path must not contain wild cards.
5.  A path has to be relative to the project path.
6.  A path has to point to folder.
7.  The folder a defined path points to must exist in the project (but in case of non-existent folders of source fragments, only a warning is shown).
--


.Module Specifiers
[req,id=IDE-160,version=1]
--
Module Specifiers are constrained in the following
way:

1.  Within a module filter type no duplicate specifiers are allowed.
2.  A module specifier is by default applied relatively to all defined source containers, i.e. if there src and src2 defined as source containers in both folders files are looked up that matches the given module specifier
3.  A module specifier can be constrained to be applied only to a certain source container.
4.  A module specifier is allowed to contain wildcards but it must resolve to some existing files in the project
--

.Module Specifier Wildcard Constraints
[req,id=IDE-161,version=1]
--
. All path patterns are case sensitive.
. `pass:[**]` all module specifiers will be matched.
. `pass:[**/*]` all module specifiers will be matched.
. `test/A??` matches all module specifiers whose qualified name consists of two segments where the first part matches test and the second part starts with an `A` and then two more characters.
.  `pass:[**/test/**/XYZ]` - matches all module specifiers whose qualified name contains a segment that matches test and the last segment ends with an ’XYZ’.
.  A module specifier wild card isn’t allowed to contain ``pass:[***]``.
.  A module specifier wild card isn’t allowed to contain relative navigation.
.  A module specifier wild card shouldn’t contain the file extension (only state the file name (pattern) without extension, valid file extensions will then be used to match the file).
--

Examples of using external source fragments and filters are given in <<_implementation-of-external-declarations>>, see <<external-definitions-and-implementations>>.


.Dependencies to Definition Projects
[req,id=GH-821001,version=1]
--
. For each listed project dependency of type "definition", a corresponding dependency (in the (dev)dependencies section) must be declared, whose "name" matches the "definesPackage" property value of the definition project.
--



[.language-n4js]
== Support for NPM Scopes

NPM supports a namespace concept for npm packages. Such namespaces are called "scopes". For details see
https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope and https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/scoped-packages.
In N4JS, this is supported too.

Terminology:

1. A project's _plain project name_ is its name without mentioning the project's scope (if any),
   e.g. `myProject`.
2. A project's _scope name_ is the name of the npm scope a project resides in, including a leading `@`.
   E.g. `@myScope`.
3. A project's _N4JS project name_ is its plain project name, prefixed by its scope name (if any),
   separated by a `/`. For unscoped projects, this is identical to the plain project name.
   E.g., `myProject` (if unscoped), `@myScope/myProject` (if scoped).
4. A project's _Eclipse project name_ is an ancillary name used only within the Eclipse UI for
   the project in the workspace. It is equal to the N4JS project name, except that `:` instead of `/` is
   used as separator between the scope and plain project name.
   E.g., `myProject` (if unscoped), `@myScope:myProject` (if scoped).

In case the intended meaning is apparent from the context, the "N4JS project name" can simply be referred to
as "project name" (as is common practice in the context of npm).

In N4JS, when importing from a module `M` contained in a scoped project `@myScope/myProject`, the import statement's
module specifier should have one of the following forms:

* `import * as N from "a/b/c/M";`
* `import * as N from "@myScope/myProject/a/b/c/M";`
* `import * as N from "@myScope/myProject";` (if `M` is specified as main module in `myProject`'s package.json)

Thus, the N4JS project name, which includes the scope name, is simply used in place of an ordinary, non-scoped
project's name. This is in line with conventions in Javascript.

.General Constraints
[req,id=GH-1026,version=1]
--
1. The name given in the package.json file (i.e. value of top-level property "name") must be equal to
   the project's "N4JS project name", as defined above.
2. The name of the project folder on disk (i.e. folder containing the package.json file) must be equal to
   the project's "plain project name", as defined above.
3. Iff the project is scoped, this project folder must have a parent folder with a name equal to
   the project's "scope name", including the leading `@`.
4. Within Eclipse, the name of of an N4JS project in the workspace UI must be equal to the project's
   "Eclipse project name", as defined above.
--



[.language-n4js]
== Component Dependencies

There are several dependencies between components.
We can distinguish between _require_ dependencies and _provide_ dependencies.

require::
  _N4JS Components_ require:
* _APIs_
* _RuntimeLiberaries_ and
* _Libraries_
provide::
* _Runtime Environments_ provide _Runtime Libraries_ and maybe extend other _Runtime Environments_ (which means they provide the same runtime libraries as the extended environments and the same base types).
* _SysLibs_ implement (__provide implementations__ of) _APIs_

=== Runtime Environment Resolution

In order to execute (run, debug, or test) an __N4JS Component__, an actual _runner_ has to be determined.
Since runners support runtime environments, this basically means calculating runtime environments which provide all necessary runtime libraries needed by the component.
This is done by computing the transitive closure of required runtime libraries and by comparing that with the transitive closure of runtime libraries provided by an environment.


.Transitive Component Dependencies
[def]
--
We defined the following transitive closures of dependencies:

For a given N4JS Component `C` we define

[math]
++++
\beginalign
 C.requiredAPIs^* & = C.requiredPIs \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{L \in C.requiredLibs}C.requiredPIs^* \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{S \in C.requiredAPIs}S.requiredAPIs^* \\
C.requiredLibs^*    & = C.requiredRTLibs \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{L \in C.requiredLibs}L.requiredRTLibs^*
\endalign
++++

For a given Runtime Environment `E` we define

[math]
++++
\beginalign
E.providedRTLibs^* & = E.providedRTLibs \\
                    & \hspace{4em} \cup \\
                    & \bigcup_{ES \in E.extendedRTEnvs} ES.E.providedRTLibs^*
\endalign
++++

--


.Runtime Environment Resolution
[req,id=IDE-162,version=1]
--
An N4JS Component `C` can be executed in an runtime environment `E`, written as $E \models C$ if the following constraints hold: +

. The environment must provide all runtime libraries transitively required by the component:
+
[math]
++++
\forall R \in C.requiredRTLibs^*: R \in E.providedRTLibs^ *
++++
. There exist libraries which can be executed by the environment, so that all APIs are implemented:
+
[math]
++++
\forall S \in C.requiredAPIs^*: \exists I: S \in I.implementedAPIs \land E \models I
++++

--

[.language-n4js]
== Modules


All N4JS files are modules, sometimes also called compilation unit (CU).
This is the overall structure of a module, based on cite:[ECMA15a(S14)].

[source,xtext]
----
Script: {Script}
    annotations+=ScriptAnnotation*
    scriptElements+=ScriptElement*;

/*
 * The top level elements in a script are type declarations, exports, imports or statements
 */
ScriptElement:
      AnnotatedScriptElement
    | N4ClassDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | N4InterfaceDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | N4EnumDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | ImportDeclaration
    | ExportDeclaration
    | RootStatement<Yield=false>
;
----

Grammar and semantics of import statement is described in <<_import-statement>>; of export statement described in <<_export-statement>>.


An import statement imports a variable declaration, function declaration, or N4 type declaration defined and exported by another module into the current
module under the given alias (which is similar to the original name if no alias is defined).
The name of the module is its project’s source folder’s relative path without any extension, see <<_qualified-names>> for details.

This are the properties of script, which can be specified by the user:


`annotations` :: Arbitrary annotations, see <<_annotations>> and below for details.

`scriptElements`:: The content of the script.

And we additionally define the following pseudo properties:

`path` :: File system path (path delimiter is always `’/’`) relative to the source fragment of the file without the extension.
E.g.: given a source folder `src`, `path` of a module located at:
+
* `src/n4/lang/List.js` is `n4/lang/List`
* `src/n4/lang/Objects.prototypes` is `n4/lang/Objects`

`expandedPath` :: Pseudo property consists of the project name and project version of the module followed by the path,
the concrete syntax is: `<project.name>-<project.version>/<module.path>` where project version includes all version parts except the qualifier.
+
E.g. given a module with path `n4/lang/List` in a project `lib` with
version `1.0.0`, the `expandedPath` is `lib-1.0.0/n4/lang/List`.

`loadtimeDeps` :: Pseudo property contains all load time dependencies of this module.

`runtimeDeps` :: Pseudo property contains all runtime dependencies of this module.

`allDeps` :: Pseudo property contains all dependencies of this module.
This is the union of _loadtimeDeps_ and _runtimeDeps_ which maintains the ordering of both lists, with the _loadtimeDeps_ at the front.

Pseudo properties to be set via annotations are explained in <<_annotations>>.

== Properties Files

//\Rightarrowdo{review}

Properties files have the file extension `properties` and describe how to localize text in a project.
They basically define keys <<_primitive-pathselector-and-i18nkey>> with their values.
The key is used during runtime to retrieve text localized to the user’s locale.

=== Syntax

The syntax of a resource file is defined as:

[source,xtext]
----
ResourceFile:   Comment* | $entry+=$ Entry*;
Comment:        'pass:[#]' .* EOL;
Entry:          $key$ = KeyIdentifier '=' $value$ = .* EOL;
KeyIdentifier:  LETTER (DIGIT | LETTER | '.')*;
----

// Added pass above for editor syntax highlighting.

=== Constraints

Properties files have to be stored in source fragment of type source.
The _base folder_ for storing the properties files of a project $p$ is $p.name\lstnfjs{/nls}$.
The language-specific resource files are stored in subfolders of the base folder.
The base language (normally english) has to be located in a subfolder of the base folder.
The resource files for other languages have to be located in a subfolder with the name given by syntax `<ISO Language Code>pass:[_]<ISO Country Code>`,
where ISO Language Code is given by the ISO-639 standard and ISO Country Code is given by the ISO-3166 standard.

All resource files stored in a language folder are compiled to a JavaScript file which exports all resource keys as an object literal.

The resource files of a project are automatically loaded.
To access a resource key `key` stored in a resource file `my.properties`, you have to use the file name as a prefix (e.g. you have to use the key `my.key`).

== API and Implementation Components

Instead of providing an implementation, N4JS components may only define an API by way of one or more n4jsd files which is then implemented by separate implementation projects.
For one such API project, several implementation projects may be provided.
Client code using the API will always be bound to the API project only, i.e. only the API project will appear in the client project’s `package.json` file under `dependencies`.
When launching the client code, the launcher will choose an appropriate implementation for each API project in the client code’s direct or indirect dependencies
and transparently replace the API project by the implementation project.
In other words, instead of the API project’s output folder, the implementation project’s output folder will be put on the class path.
Static compile time validations ensure that the implementation projects comply to their corresponding API project.

Note how this concept can be seen as an alternative way of providing the implementation for an n4jsd file: usually n4jsd files are used to define types
that are implemented in plain JavaScript code or provided by the runtime; this concept allows for providing the implementation of an n4jsd file in form of ordinary N4JS code.

At this time, the concept of API and implementation components is in a prototype phase and the tool support is limited.
The goal is to gain experience from using the early prototype support and then refine the concept over time.

Here is a summary of the most important details of this concept (they
are all subject to discussion and change):

* Support for this concept, esp. validations, should not be built into the core language but rather implemented as a separate validation/analysis tool.
* Validation is currently provided in the form of a separate view: the API / Implementation compare view.
* A project that defines one or more other projects in its `package.json` file under `implementedProjects` (cf. <<package-json-implementedProjects>>) is called _implementation project_.
A project that has another project pointing to itself via `ImplementedProjects` is called _API project_.
Note that, at the moment, there is no explicit definition making a project an API project.
* An implementation project must define an implementation ID in its `package.json` file using the `implementationId` property in the `n4js` section (cf. <<package-json-implementationId>>).
* For each public or public@Internal classifier or enum in an API project, there must be a corresponding type with the same fully-qualified name of the same or higher visibility in the  implementation project.
For each member of such a type in the API, there must exist a corresponding, owned _or_ inherited type-compatible member in the implementation type.
* Beyond type compatibility, formal parameters should have the same name on API and implementation side; however, different names are legal but should be highlighted by API / Implementation tool support as a (legal) change.
* Comments regarding the state of the API or implementation may be added to the JSDoc in the source code using the special tag @apiNote.
API / Implementation tool support should extract and present this information to the user in an appropriate form.
* If an API class `C` implements an interface `I`, it has to explicitly (re-) declare all members of `I` similar to the implementation.
This is necessary for abstract classes anyway in order to distinguish the implemented methods from the non-implemented ones.
For concrete classes, we want all members in `C` in order to be complete and avoid problems when the interface is changed or `C` is made abstract.

=== Execution of API and Implementation Components

When launching an N4JS component _C_ under runtime environment <<AC,RE>>, the user may(!) provide an implementation ID $I\!I\!D$ to run.
Then, for each API project _A_ in the direct or indirect dependencies of _C_ an implementation project is chosen as follows:

. Collect all implementation projects for _A_ (i.e. projects that specify _A_ in their `package.json` file under `implementedProjects`).
. Remove implementation projects that cannot be run under runtime environment <<AC,RE>>, using the same logic as for running ordinary N4JS components (this step is not implemented yet!).
.  If there are no implementation projects left, show an error.
.  If $I\!I\!D$ is defined (i.e. user specified an implementation ID to run), then:
..  If there is an implementation project left with implementation ID $I\!I\!D$, use that.
..  Otherwise, show an error.
.  If $I\!I\!D$ is undefined, then
..  If there is exactly 1 implementation project left, use it.
..  Otherwise, in UI mode prompt the user for a choice, in headless mode  how an error.

Having found an implementation project $I_n$ for each API project $A_n$, launch as usual except that whenever $A_n$’s output folder would be used, use $I_n$’s
output folder (esp. when constructing a `class path`) and when loading or importing a type from $A_n$ return the corresponding type with the same fully-qualified name from $I_n$.

== API and Implementation With DI

API projects may use N4JS DI (<<_dependency-injection>>) language features which require Implementation projects to provide DI-compatible behaviour
in order to allow a Client (implemented against an API project) to be executed with a given Implementation project.
This is essential for normal execution and for test execution.

<<diag_APITestsDI_Overview>> shows some of those considerations from test client point of view.

[[diag_APITestsDI_Overview]]
.Overview of API tests with DI
image::{find}fig/diag_ApiTestsDI_Overview.svg[]

Static DI mechanisms in N4JS allow an API project to enforce Implementation projects to provide all necessary information.
This allows clients to work seamlessly with various implementations without specific knowledge about them or without relying on extra tools for proper project wiring.

<<diag_ApiTestsDI_StaticDI>> shows how API project defines project wiring and enforces certain level of testability.

[[diag_ApiTestsDI_StaticDI]]
.API tests with static DI

During Client execution, weather it is test execution or not, N4JS mechanisms will replace the API project with a proper Implementation project.
During runtime DI mechanisms will take care of providing proper instances of implantation types.

<<diag_ApiTestsDI_Views>> shows Types View perspective of the client, and Instances View perspective of the client.
