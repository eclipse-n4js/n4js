= N4JS Specific Classifiers


N4JS provides three new metatypes: class, interface, and enums.
In this section we describe classes and interfaces.
These metatypes, called __classifiers__, share some common properties which are described before type specific properties are outlined in the following sections.

All of these metatypes can be marked with type access modifiers:

[source,xtext]
----
enum N4JSTypeAccessModifier: project | public;
----

[.language-n4js]
== Properties

*Properties defined by syntactic elements:*


`annotations` ::
Arbitrary annotations, see <<Annotations>> for details.

`accessModifier` ::
N4JS type access modifier: `public`, or `project`;  `public` can be combined with `@Internal`; if
*export* is `true` the default is else the default is `private`.



`name` ::
The simple name of a classifier. If the classifier is defined by an anonymous class expression, an artificial but unique name is created.
The name needs to be a valid identifier, see <<_valid-names>>.

`typePars` ::
Collection of type parameters of a generic classifier; empty by default.


`ownedMembers` ::
Collection of owned members, i.e. methods and fields defined directly in the classifier and, if present, the explicitly defined constructor.
Depending on the concrete classifier, additional constraints are defined.

`typingStrategy` ::
The definition-site typing strategy. By default nominal typing is used.
See <<_structural-typing>> for details.

*The following pseudo properties are defined via annotations:*


`export` ::
Boolean property set to true if the `export` modifier is set.
If value is true, the classifier may be accessible outside the project.



`final` ::
Boolean property which is set to final if annotation `@Final` is set.
Also see <<_final-modifier>>

`deprecated` ::
Boolean property set to true if annotation `@Deprecated` is set.
+
NOTE: Version 0.4, not implemented in Version 0.3



*We additionally define the following pseudo properties:*


`acc` ::
Type access modifier as described in <<_accessibility-of-types-top-level-variables-and-function-declarations>>, it is the aggregated value of the
`accessModifier` and the *export* property.

`owned{Fields|Methods|Getters|Setters|Accessors}` ::
Filters ownedMembers by metatype, short for +
$x \in ownedMembers, \mu(x)=\type{Field}$ etc.

`members` ::
Reflexive transitive closure of all members of a classifier and its super classifiers, see <<Common Semantics of Classifiers>> on how this is calculated.

`fields|methods|getters|setters|accessors` ::
Filters members by metatype, short for +
$x \in members, \mu(x)=\type{Field}$ etc.

`superClassifiers` ::
Classes and interface may extend or implement classes or interfaces.
Any class or interface extended or interface implemented is called __super classifier__.
We distinguish the directly subtyped classifiers and from the transitive closure of supertypes $ superClassifiers^* $

== Common Semantics of Classifiers


.Subtyping of Classifiers
[req,id=IDE-42,version=1]
--
For a given type `C`, and supertypes $superClassifiers = \{S_1,\dots, S_n\}$ directly subtyped
`C`, the following constraints must be true:

1.  The supertypes must be accessible to the subtype: +
$S_1, \dots, S_n$ must be accessible to `C`.
2.  All type parameters of the direct supertypes have to be bound by type arguments in the subtype and the type arguments have to be substitutable types of the type parameters.
+
$\forall 0<i\leq k: \forall P \in S_i:$ +
$\exists A \in C_.typeArgs: bind(A, P) \land A.upperBound <: P.upperBound$
3.  Wildcards may not be used as type argument when binding a supertype’s type parameters.
4.  A classifier cannot be directly subtyped directly multiple times: +
$\forall S_i, S_j (i,j \in \{1..n\}): S_i = S_j \to i=j$

In order to simplify the following constraints, we use the pseudo property $members$ to refer to all members of a classifier.
This includes all members directly declared by the classifier itself, i.e. the $ownedMember$, and all members inherited from its super classifiers.
The concrete mechanisms for inheriting a member are different and further constraint (cf. <<_redefinition-of-members>>).
A classifier only inherits its members from its direct supertypes, although the supertypes may contains members inherited from their supertypes.
--

[.language-n4js]
== Classes

=== Definition of Classes

Classes are either declared with a class declaration on top level, or they can be used as anonymous classes in expressions.
The latter may have a name, which may be used for error messages and reflection.

At the current stage, class expressions are effectively disabled at least until the semantics of them are finalized in ECMAScript 6.

// \todo{SZ: Reconsider this. The test suites contains a couple of examples with class expressions and they don't look unreasonable to me. If we really want that, the code in ASTStructureValidator for N4ClassExpressions should be enabled.}

In N4JS (as in many other languages) multi-inheritance of classes is not supported.
Although the `diamond problem` (of functions being defined in both superclasses) could be solved via union and intersection types, this would lead to problems when calling these super implementations.
This is particularly an issue due to JavaScript not supporting
multiple prototypes.footnote:[E.g., for given [language-n4js]`class A{ foo(A):A{}} class B{ foo(B):B{}}`, a class C could be defined as [language-n4js]`class C{ foo(union{A,B}):intersection{A,B}{}}`. In this case it would then be a syntactical problem (and even worse - a conceptual problem) of how to call the super methods defined in A and Bfrom C.]
Interfaces, however, allow for multi-inheritance. Since the former can also define functions with bodies, this is not a hard restriction.

==== Properties [[class-properties]]

These are the properties of class, which can be specified by the user:
Syntax N4 Class Declaration and Expression

`abstract` ::
Boolean flag indicating whether class may be instantiable; default is `false`, see <<_abstract-classes>>.

`external` ::
Boolean flag indicating whether class is a declaration without implementation or with an external (non-N4JS) implementation; default is `false`, see <<_definition-site-structural-typing>>.

`defStructural` ::
Boolean flag indicating whether subtype relation uses nominal or structural typing, see <<_definition-site-structural-typing>> for details.

`superType/sup` ::
The type referenced by $superType$ is called direct superclass of a class, and vice versa the class is a direct subclass of $superType$.
Instead of $superType$, we sometimes simply write $sup$.
The derived set $sup^+$ is defined as the transitive closures of all direct and indirect superclasses of a class.
If no supertype is explicitly stated, classes are derived from `N4Object`.

`implementedInterfaces`/`interfaces` ::
Collection of interfaces directly _implemented_ by the class; empty by default.
Instead of `implementedInterfaces`, we simply write `interfaces`.

`ownedCtor` ::
Explicit constructor of a class (if any), see <<_constructor-and-classifier-type>>.

And we additionally define the following pseudo properties:

`ctor` ::
Explicit or implicit constructor of a class, see <<_constructor-and-classifier-type>>.

`fields` ::
Further derived properties for retrieving all methods (property $methods$), fields (property $fields$), static
members (property $staticOwnedMembers$), etc. can easily be added by filtering properties $members$ or $ownedMembers$.

==== Type Inference [[class-type-inference]]

The type of a class declaration or class expression `C` (i.e., a class definition in general) is of type `constructor{C}` if it is not abstract,
that is if it can be instantiated.
If it is abstract, the type of the definition simply is `type{C}`:

[math]
++++
\beginalign
\infer{\tee C : \type{constructor}\{C\}}{\lnot C.abstract}\\
\infer{\tee C : \type{type}\{C\}}{C.abstract}
\endalign
++++


.Structural and Nominal Supertypes
[req,id=IDE-43,version=1]
--
The type of supertypes and implemented interfaces is always the nominal type, even if the supertype is declared structurally.

[math]
++++
\beginalign
\infer{\tee T.sup: \tsNom \tee S}{bind(T.sup, S)} \\
\infer{\tee I: \tsNom \tee S}{I \in T.interfaces & bind(I, S)}
\endalign
++++

--

=== Semantics [[class-semantics]]

This section deals with the (more or less) type-independent constraints on classes.

Class expressions are not fully supported at the moment.
//todo[class expressions]{check class expressions}

.Transitive closure of members
[def]
--
The reflexive transitive closure of members of a class is indirectly defined by the override and implementation constraints defined in <<_redefinition-of-members>>.

Note that since overloading is forbidden, the following constraint is true footnote:[$accessorPair(m_1,m_2)$ is defined as follows: $(\mu(m_1)=\type{getter}\land \mu(m_2)=\type{setter}) \lor (\mu(m_1)=\type{setter}\land \mu(m_2)=\type{getter})$]:


[math]
++++
\forall m_1,m_2 \in members: m_{1}.name=m_{2}.name \iff m_1=m_2 \lor accessorPair(m_1, m_2)
++++


Remarks: Class and method definition is quite similar to the proposed ECMAScript version 6 draft cite:[ECMA15a(S13.5)], except that an N4 class and members may contain

* annotations, abstract and access modifiers
* fields
* types
* implemented interfaces

Note that even `static` is used in ECMAScript 6.
--

Mixing in members (i.e. interface’s methods with default implementation or fields) is similar to mixing in members from roles as defined in cite:[Dart13a(S9.1)].
It is also similar to default implementations in Java 8 cite:[Gosling15a].
In Java, however, more constraints exist, (for example, methods of interfaces must be public).

.Simple Class
[example]
====
This first example shows a very simple class with a field, a constructor and a method.

[source,n4js]
----
class C {
    data: any;

    constructor(data: any) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    foo(): void { }
}
----

====

.Extend and implement
[example]
--
The following example demonstrate how a class can extend a superclass and implement an interface.

[source,n4js]
----
interface I {
    foo(): void
}
class C{}
class X extends C implements I {
    @Override
    foo(): void {}
}
----
--

A class `C` is a subtype of another classifier `S` (which can be a class or interface) if the other classifier `S` is (transitively) contained in the supertypes (superclasses or implemented interfaces) of the class:

[math]
++++
\infer{\tee \type{TClass}\ left \subtype[TClass]\ right}{left=right}[shortcut] \\
++++
[math]
++++
\infer{\tee \type{TClass}\ left \subtype[TClass]\ right}{\tee  left.superType.declaredType \subtype right}
++++


.Implicit Supertype of Classes
[req,id=IDE-44,version=1]
--
1.  The implicit supertype of all classes is `N4Object`.
All classes with no explicit supertype are inherited from `N4Object`.
2.  If the supertype is explicitly set to `Object`, then the class is not derived from `N4Object`.
Meta-information is created similar to an `N4Object`-derived class.
Usually, there is no reason to explicitly derive a class from `Object`.
3.  External classes are implicitly derived from , unless they are annotated with `@N4JS`(cf.<<_external-declarations>>).
--

//TODO missing notation above ^

=== Final Modifier


Extensibility refers to whether a given classifier can be subtyped.
Accessibility is a prerequisite for extensibility.
If a type cannot be seen, it cannot be subclassed.
The only modifier influencing the extensibility directly is the annotation `@Final`, which prevents all subtyping.
The following table shows how to prevent other projects or vendors from subtyping by also restricting the accessibility of the constructor:

.Extensibility of Types
[cols="<5,^,^,^"]
|===
^|Type `C` Settings 3+| Subclassed in

||*Project* |*Vendor* |*World*
m|C.final |no |no |no
m|C.ctor.accessModifier=\lenum{project} |yes |no |no
m|C.ctor.accessModifier=\lenum{public@Internal} |yes |yes |no
|===

Since interfaces are always to be implemented, they must not be declared final.

=== Abstract Classes

A class with modifier `abstract` is called an _abstract class_ and has its $abstract$ property set to true.
Other classes are called _concrete_ classes.

.Abstract Class
[req,id=IDE-45,version=1]
--

1.  A class `C` must be declared abstract if it owns or inherits one or more abstract members and neither C nor any interfaces implemented by C implements these members.
//% $\exists m \in C.members: m.abstract \Rightarrow C.abstract$ \task*{IDE-553}
A concrete class has to, therefore, implement all abstract members of its superclasses’ implemented interfaces.
Note that a class may implement fields with field accessors and vice versa.
2.  An abstract class may not be instantiated.
3.  An abstract class cannot be set to final (with annotation `@Final`).
--

.Abstract Member
[req,id=IDE-46,version=1]
--
task::GH-1047[]

1.  A member declared as abstract must not have a method body (in contrary a method not declared as abstract have to have a method body).
2.  Only methods, getters and setters can be declared as abstract (fields cannot be abstract).
3.  It is not possible to inherit from an abstract class which contains abstract members which are not visible in the subclass.
4.  An abstract member must not be set to final (with annotation `@Final`).
5.  Static members must not be declared abstract.
--

Remarks:

* We decided to disallow abstract static members, since we cannot guarantee that a static members is not accessed in all cases
* Only static members can override static members and only instance members can override other instance members of course.
* An abstract member must not be declared in a final class (i.e. a class annotated with `@Final`). This is not explicitly defined as constraint in <<Req-IDE-46>> since abstract classes must not defined final anyway. We also do not produce error message for abstract members in final classes since these errors would be consequential errors.


WARNING: Abstract members might be declared private, as they can be accessed from within the module.
This is to be changed in order to be aligned with TypeScript, cf. task:GH-1221[]. However we also want to add class expressions -- and then the abstract members may be accessed (and overridden) in nested classes created by means of class expressions.

=== Non-Instantiable Classes

To make a class non-instantiable outside a defining compilation unit, i.e. disallow creation of instances for this class, simply declare the constructor as private.
This can be used for singletons.

=== Superclass


.Superclass
[req,id=IDE-47,version=1]
--
For a class `C` with a supertype $S=C.sup$, the following constraints must hold;

* $C.sup$ must reference a class declaration `S`
* `S` must be be extendable in the project of `C`
* $ C \not\in C.sup^+ $
* All abstract members in `S` must be accessible from `C`:
+
$\forall M \in S.members : M.abstract \Rightarrow $ +
`M` is accessible from `C`. +
Note that `M` need not be an owned member of `S` and that this constraint applies even if `C` is abstract).

All members of superclasses become members of a class.
This is true even if the owning classes are not directly accessible to a class.
The member-specific access control is not changed.

== Interfaces

----


==== Properties [[interfaces-properties]]
These are the additional properties of interfaces, which can be specified by the user:

`superInterfaces`::
Collection of interfaces extended by this interface; empty by default.
Instead of `superInterfaces`, we simply write `interfaces`.

==== Type Inference [[interfaces-type-inference]]

The type of an interface declaration `I` is of type `type{I}`:

[math]
++++
\infer{\tee I: \type{type}\{I\}}{}
++++

==== Semantics [[interfaces-semantics]]

Interfaces are used to describe the public <<Acronyms,API>> of a classifier.
The main requirement is that the instance of an interface, which must be an instance of a class since interfaces cannot have instances, provides all members declared in the interface.
Thus, a (concrete) class implementing an interface must provide implementations for all the fields, methods, getters and setters of the interface (otherwise it the class must be declared abstract).
The implementations have to be provided either directly in the class itself, through a superclass, or by the interface if the member has a default implementation.

A field declaration in an interface denotes that all implementing classes can either provide a field of the same name and the same(!) type or corresponding field accessors.
If no such members are defined in the class or a (transitive) superclass, the field is mixed in from the interface automatically.
This is also true for the initializer of the field.

All instance methods, getters and setters declared in an interface are implicitly abstract if they do not provide a default implementation.
The modifier `abstract` is not required, therefore, in the source code.
The following constraints apply:

.Interfaces
[req,id=IDE-48,version=1]
--
For any interface `I`, the following must hold:

. Interfaces may not be instantiated.
. Interfaces cannot be set to final (with annotation @Final): $\neg I.final$.
. Members of an interface must not be declared private.
The default access modifier in interfaces is the the type’s visibility or `project`, if the type’s visibility is `private`.
. Members of an interface, except methods, must not be declared `@Final`:
+
[math]
++++
\forall m \in I.member: m.final \to m \in I.methods
++++
+
NOTE: not allowing field accessors to be declared final was a deliberate decision, because it would complicate the internal handling of member redefinition; might be reconsidered at a later time
. The literal may not be used in the initializer expression of a field of an interface. +
This restriction is required, because the order of implementation of these fields in an implementing class cannot be guaranteed.
This applies to both instance and static fields in interfaces, but in case of static fields, `this` is also disallowed due to <<_static-members-of-interfaces>>.

--

It is possible to declare members in interfaces with a smaller visibility as the interface itself.
In that case, clients of the interface may be able to use the interface but not to implement it.

In order to simplify modeling of runtime types, such as elements, interfaces do not only support the notation of static methods but constant data fields as well.
Since <<Acronyms,IDL>> cite:[OMG14a] is used to describe these elements in specifications (and mapped to JavaScript via rules described in cite:[W3C12a])
constant data fields are an often-used technique there and they can be modeled in N4JS 1:1.

// todo[IDE-1236]{check current implementation: fields and methods}

As specified in <<Req-IDE-56>>, interfaces cannot contain a constructor i.e. +
$\forall m \in I.ownedMethods: m.name \neq 'constructor'$.

.Simple Interfaces
[example]
--
The following example shows the syntax for defining interfaces.
The second interface extends the first one.
Note that methods are implicitly defined abstract in interfaces.

[source,n4js]
----
interface I {
    foo(): void
}
interface I2 extends I {
    someText: string;
    bar(): void
}
----
--

If a classifier `C` _implements_ an interface `I`, we say `I` is _implemented_ by `C`.
If `C` redefines members declared in `I`, we say that these members are _implemented_ by `C`.
Members not redefined by `C` but with a default implementations are _mixed in_ or _consumed by_ `C`.
We all cases we call `C` the __implementor__.

Besides the general constraints described in <<_common-semantics-of-classifiers>>, the following constraints must hold for extending or implementing interfaces:

.Extending Interfaces
[req,id=IDE-49,version=1]
--
For a given type
`I`, and $\{I_1,\dots, I_n\}$ directly extended by `I`, the following constraints must be true:

.  Only interfaces can extend interfaces: $I, I_1, \dots, I_n$ must be interfaces.
.  An interface may not directly extend the same interface more than once: +
$I_i=I_j \to i=j$ for any
$i,j \in \{1 \dots n\}$.
.  An interface may (indirectly) extend the same interface $J$ more than once only if
..  $J$ is not parameterized, or
..  in all cases $J$ is extended with the same type arguments for all invariant type parameters. +
Note that for type parameters of $J$ that are declared covariant or contravariant on definition site, different type arguments may be used.
.  All abstract members in $I_i$, $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, must be accessible from `I`: +
$\forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\} : M \in I_i.members \land M.abstract \to $ `M` is accessible from `I`. +
Note that `M` need not be an owned member of $I_i$.
--

.Implementing Interfaces
[req,id=IDE-50,version=1]
--

For a given type
`C`, and $\{I_1,\dots, I_n\}$ directly implemented
by `C`, the following constraints must be true:

.  Only classes can implement interfaces: `C` must be a Class.
.  A class can only implement interfaces: $I_1, \dots, I_n$ must be interfaces.
.  A class may not directly implement the same interface more than once: +
$I_i=I_j \Rightarrow i=j$ for any $i,j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$.
.  A class may (indirectly) implement the same interface $J$ more than once only if
..  $J$ is not parameterized, or
..  in all cases $J$ is implemented with the same type arguments for all invariant type parameters. +
Note that for type parameters of $J$ that are declared covariant or contravariant on definition site, different type arguments may be used.
.  All abstract members in $I_i$, $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, must be accessible from `C`: +
$\forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\} : M \in I_i.members \land M.abstract \to $ `M` is accessible from `C`. +
Note that `M` need not be an owned member of $I_i$.

[.language-n4js]
== Generic Classifiers


Classifiers can be declared generic by defining a type parameter via `type-param`.

.Generic Classifiers
[def]
--
A generic classifier is a classifier with at least one type parameter.
That is, a given classifier `C` is generic if and only if $|C.typePars|\geq 1$.

If a classifier does not define any type parameters, it is not generic, even if its superclass or any implemented interface is generic.

The format of the type parameter expression is described in <<_parameterized-types>>.
The type variable defined by the type parameter’s type expression can be used just like a normal type inside the class definition.

If using a generic classifier as type of a variable, it may be parameterized.
This is usually done via a type expression (cf. <<_parameterized-types>>) or via `typearg` in case of supertypes.
If a generic classifier defines multiple type variables, these variables are bound in the order of their definition.
In any case, all type variables have to be bound.
That means in particular that raw types are not allowed. (cf <<_parameterized-types>> for details).

If a generic classifier is used as super classifier, the type arguments can be type variables.
Note that the type variable of the super classifier is not lifted, that is to say that all type variables are to be explicitly bound in the type references used in the `extend`, `with`, or `implements` section using `typearg`.
If a type variable is used in `typearg` to bound a type variable of a type parameter, it has to fulfil possible type constraints (upper/lower bound) specified in the type parameter.
--


.Generic Type Definition and Usage as Type of Variable
[example]
====
This example demonstrates how to define a generic type and how to refer to it in a variable definition.

[source,n4js]
----
export class Container<T> {
    private item: T;

    getItem(): T {
        return this.item;
    }

    setItem(item: T): void {
        this.item = item;
    }
}
----

====

This type can now be used as a type of a variable as follows

[source,n4js]
----
import Container from "p/Container"

var stringContainer: Container<string> = new Container<string>();
stringContainer.setItem("Hello");
var s: string = stringContainer.getItem();
----

In line 3, the type variable `T` of the generic class `Container` is bound to `string`.

.Binding of type variables with multiple types
[example]
====
For a given generic class `G`

[source,n4js]
----
class A{}
class B{}
class C extends A{}

class G<S, T extends A, U extends B> {
}
----

the variable definition

[source,n4js]
----
var x: G<Number,C,B>;
----

would bind the type variables as follows:

[cols="^1m,^1m,^4"]
|===
| S | Number |Bound by first type argument, no bound constraints defined for `S`.
| T | C | Bound by second type argument, `C` must be a subtype of in order to fulfill the type constraint.
| U | B |Bound by third type argument, `extends` is reflexive, that is `B` fulfills the
type constraint.
|===

----
class SubClass<X extends A> extends SuperClass<Number, X, B> {..};
----

the variable definition

[source,n4js]
----
var s: SubClass<C>;
----

would bind the type variables as follows: +


[cols="^1m,^1m,4"]
|===
| TypeVariable | Bound to ^| Explanation

| SuperClass.S | Number | Type variable `s` of supertype `SuperClass` is bound to `Number`.
| SuperClass.T | SubClass.X=C | Type variable `T` of supertype `SuperClass` is bound to type variable `X` of `SubClass`. It gets
then indirectly bound to `C` as specified by the type argument of the
variable definition.

| SuperClass.U | B |Type variable `U` of supertype `SuperClass` is auto-bound to `C` as no explicit binding for the third type variable is specified.
| SubClass.X | C |Bound by first type argument specified in variable definition.

[[sec:definition-site-variance]]
== Definition-Site Variance

In addition to use-site declaration of variance in the form of Java-like wildcards, N4JS provides support for definition-site declaration of variance as known from languages such as C# and Scala.

The _variance_ of a parameterized type states how its subtyping relates to its type arguments’ subtyping.
For example, given a parameterized type `G<T>` and plain types `A` and `B`, we know

Note that variance is declared per type parameter, so a single parameterized type with more than one type parameter may be, for example, covariant w.r.t. one type parameter and contravariant w.r.t. another.

Strictly speaking, a type parameter/variable itself is not co- or contravariant; +
however, for the sake of simplicity we say __``T`` is covariant__ as a short form for __``G`` is covariant with respect to its type parameter ``T``__ (for contravariant and invariant accordingly).

To declare the variance of a parameterized classifier on definition site, simply add keyword `in` or `out` before the corresponding type parameter:

[source,n4js]
----
class ReadOnlyList<out T> { // covariance
    // ...
}

interface Consumer<in T> { // contravariance
    // ...
}
----

In such cases, the following constraints apply.

.Definition-Site Variance
[req,id=IDE-174,version=1]
--
Given a parameterized type with a type parameter , the following must hold:

. `T` may only appear in variance-compatible positions:
..  if `T` is declared on definition site to be **covariant**, then it may only appear in covariant positions within the type’s non-private member declarations.
..  if `T` is declared on definition site to be **contravariant**, then it may only appear in contravariant positions within the type’s non-private member declarations.
..  if `T` is **invariant**, i.e. neither declared covariant nor declared contravariant on definition site, then it may appear in any position (where type variables are allowed).
+
Thus, no restrictions apply within the declaration of private members and within the body of field accessors and methods.
.  definition-site variance may not be combined with incompatible use-site variance:
..  if `T` is declared on definition site to be **covariant**, then no wildcard with a *lower* bound may be provided as type argument for `T`.
..  if `T` is declared on definition site to be **contravariant**, then no wildcard with an *upper* bound may be provided as type argument for `T`.
..  if `T` is **invariant**, i.e. neither declared covariant nor declared contravariant on definition site, then any kind of wildcard may be provided as type argument.
+
Unbounded wildcards are allowed in all cases.

.Use-site declaration of variance
[example]
====
For illustration purposes, let’s compare use-site and definition-site declaration of variance.
Since use-site variance is more familiar to the Java developer, we start with this flavor.

[source,n4js]
----
class Person {
    name: string;
}
class Employee extends Person {}

interface List<T> {
    add(elem: T)
    read(idx: int): T
}

function getNameOfFirstPerson(list: List<? extends Person>): string {
    return list.read(0).name;
}
----

Function `getNameOfFirstPerson` below takes a list and returns the name of the first person in the list.
Since it never adds new elements to the given list, it could accept ``List``s of any subtype of `Person`, for example a `List<Employee>`.
To allow this, its formal parameter has a type of `List<? extends Person>` instead of `List<Person>`.
Such use-site variance is useful whenever an invariant type, like `List` above, is being used in a way such that it can be treated as if it were co- or contravariant.

Sometimes, however, we are dealing with types that are inherently covariant or contravariant, for example an `ImmutableList` from which we can only read elements would be covariant.
In such a case, use-site declaration of variance is tedious and error-prone: we would have to declare the variance wherever the type is being used and would have to
make sure not to forget the declaration or otherwise limit the flexibility and reusability of the code (for example, in the above code we could not call `getNameOfFirstPerson` with a `List<Employee>`).

The solution is to declare the variance on declaration site, as in the following code sample:

[source,n4js]
----
interface ImmutableList<out T> {
//  add(elem: T)  // error: such a method would now be disallowed
    read(idx: int): T
}

function getNameOfFirstPerson2(list: ImmutableList<Person>): string {
    return list.read(0).name;
}
----

Now we can invoke `getNameOfFirstPerson2` with a `List<Employee>` even though the implementor of `getNameOfFirstPerson2` did not add a
use-site declaration of covariance, because the type `ImmutableList` is declared to be covariant with respect to its parameter `T`, and this applies globally
throughout the program.
