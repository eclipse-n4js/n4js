The headless tool provides goals for a variety of use cases.
Compiling a given project is the most obvious use case.
Other use cases are cleaning a given project or generating the api documentation.
Moreover, the headless tool provides LSP-Server functionality and can be used as an
incremental builder daemon that listens to file system events. 



[[sec:Headless_Compiler]]
[.language-bash]
== Command Line Call

The headless compiler `n4jsc.jar` is invoked via

[source,bash]
----
java -jar n4jsc.jar [GOAL] [DIR(s)] [OPTION(s)]
----

Calling `java -jar n4jsc.jar --help` will print out all available goals and options.



=== Argument GOAL

The headless compiler provides the following goals which are executed on all given n4js projects:
compile (implicit goal)::
   Compiles all n4js files
   
clean::
   Cleans all output folders

lsp::
   Starts an lsp server

api::
   Generates api documentation

watch::
   Starts a compile daemon that watches the file system


If the call of `n4jsc` omits a goal, the implicit goal `compile` is used.


=== Argument DIR(s)

The goal is executed on a set of given projects.
The set is determined by the `DIR(s)` argument, which used to find all relevant n4js projects.


=== Finding projects

For every given directory by the `DIR` argument, the following approach is used to determine the set of all projects.
The approach considers both npm and yarn project file structures.

Firstly, a set of all projects and secondly the set of all their dependencies is determined.
The set of all project is determined as follows:
* Step 1 - Find npm projects:
** check the given directory is a project (ie. contains a package.json)
** if so, go to step 2
** if not, go from the given directory to the parent directory until it is a project:
*** if so, to to step 2
*** if no project could be found: End without any project

* Step 2 - Find yarn projects:
** If the given project is a yarn workspace project, add all projects referenced in property `workspace`
** go to step 3 

* Step 3 - Find dependencies:
** For all projects: Add projects in node_module folders
