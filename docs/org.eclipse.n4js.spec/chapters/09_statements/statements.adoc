= Statements

For all statements, we define the following pseudo properties:

[.language-n4js]
--

`containingFunction` ::
The function or method in which the statement is (indirectly) contained, this may be null.

`containingClass` ::
The class in which the statement is (indirectly) contained, this may be null.
--

The expressions and statements are ordered, at first describing the constructs available in the 5th edition of ECMA-262
referred to as  cite:[ECMA11a] in the following.
The grammar snippets already use newer constructs in some cases.

[.language-n4js]
== ECMAScript 5 Statements

N4JS supports the same statements as
ECMAScript. Some of these statements are enhanced with annotations <<Annotations>> and type information.

Although some statements may return a value which can be used via certain constructs such as `eval`), no type is inferred for any statement.
The compiler will always create a warning if a statement is used instead of an expression.

The following sections, therefore, do not define how to infer types for statement but how types and type annotations
are used in these statements and the specific type constraints for a given statement.

All syntax definitions taken from  cite:[ECMA11a]  are repeated here for convenience reasons and in order to define temporary variables for simplifying constraint definitions.
If non-terminals are not defined here, the definition specified in  cite:[ECMA11a]   is to be used.

=== Function or Field Accessor Bodies

.Dead Code
[req,id=IDE-126,version=1]
--
For all statements in a function or field accessor (getter/setter) body, the following constraints must hold:

1.  Statements appearing directly after return, throw, break, or continue statements (in the same block) are considered to be dead code and a warning is issued in these cases.

=== Variable Statement

[discrete]
==== Syntax [[variable-statement-syntax]]

A var statement can declare the type of the variable with a type
reference. This is described with the following grammar similar to
cite:[ECMA11a(S12.2,p.87)]:

[source,xtext]
----
VariableStatement <In, Yield>:
    =>({VariableStatement}
        'var'

;

VariableDeclarationOrBinding <In, Yield, OptionalInit>:
        VariableBinding<In,Yield,OptionalInit>
    |   VariableDeclaration<In,Yield,true>
;

VariableBinding <In, Yield, OptionalInit>:
    => pattern=BindingPattern<Yield> (
            <OptionalInit> ('=' expression=AssignmentExpression<In,Yield>)?
        |   <!OptionalInit> '=' expression=AssignmentExpression<In,Yield>
    )
;

VariableDeclaration <In, Yield, AllowType>:
    {VariableDeclaration} VariableDeclarationImpl<In,Yield,AllowType>;

fragment VariableDeclarationImpl <In, Yield, AllowType>*:
    annotations+=Annotation*

        ) ('=' expression=AssignmentExpression<In,Yield>)?
    |   <!AllowType> =>(
        name=BindingIdentifier<Yield>
        ) ('=' expression=AssignmentExpression<In,Yield>)?
    )
;

[discrete]
==== Semantics [[variable-statement-semantics]]

From a model and type inference point of view, variable and constant statements and declarations are similar except that the pseudo property $const$ is set to false for variables and true for constants.
Also see exported variable statement (<<Export Statement>>) and constant statement and declaration (<<Const>>).

.Variable declaration
[req,id=IDE-127,version=1]
--
For a given variable declaration $d$, the following constraints must hold:

* The type of the initializer expression must conform to the declared type:
+
[%hardbreaks]
$d.expression\neq \NULL \land d.declaredTypeRef\neq \NULL$
$         \rightarrow \tee d.expression.type \subtype \tee d.declaredTypeRef$
* The initializer expression should not contain a reference to $d$ except where the reference is contained in a class expression or function expression and
the class is not immediately initialized or the function is not immediately invoked.
In these cases, the code is executed later and the self-reference is not a problem. +
To clarify: _should not_ means that only a warning will be produced.

[source,n4js]
----
// not ok (simple case)
var n = n + 1;

// ok (class expression not fully supported)
// var cls1 = class { static sfield1 = "hello"; field2 = cls1.sfield1; };

// not ok, immediately instantiated (class expression not fully supported)
// var cls2 = new class { field1 = "hello"; field2 = cls2.field1; };

// ok
var fun1 = function() : number { var x = fun1; return -42; };

// not ok, immediately invoked
var fun2 = function() : number { var x = fun2;  return -42; }();
----

The variable statement may contain array or object destructuring patterns, see <<_array-and-object-destructuring>> for details.

[discrete]
==== Type Inference [[variable-statement-type-inference]]

The type of a variable is the type of its declaration:

[math]
++++
& \infer{\tee v: \tee d}{} \\
++++


The type of a variable declaration is either the declared type or the inferred type of the initializer expression:

[math]
++++
& \infer{\tee d: T}{d.declaredType \neq \NULL & T = d.declaredType} \\
& \infer{\tee d: T}{
    d.declaredType = \NULL & d.expression \neq \NULL \\
    E = \tee d.expression & E \not\in \{\type{null, undefined}\} & T = E} \\
& \infer{\tee d: \type{any}}{else}
++++


// \todo{known limitation: if the initializer expression is an ObjectLiteral or FunctionExpression, the variable type will be inferred to \lstnfjs{any}.

Since $varDecl(s)$ are ``VariableStatement``s as described in <<_variable-statement>>, the declared variables can be type annotated.

TIP: Using for-in is not recommended, instead ``pass:[_each]`` should be used.

[.language-n4js]
== ECMAScript 6 Statements

N4JS export and import statements are similar to ES6 with some minor d ifferences which are elaborated on below.

=== Let

Cf. cite:[ECMA11a(13.2.1)], also http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-scoping.html[Rauschmayer, 2ality: *Variables and scoping in ECMAScript 6*]

=== Const

Cf. cite:[ECMA15a(13.2.1)], also http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-scoping.html[Rauschmayer, 2ality: *Variables and scoping in ECMAScript 6*]

Additionally to the `var` statement, the `const` statement is supported.
It allows for declaring variables which must be assigned to a value in the declaration and their value must not change.
That is to say that constants are not allowed to be on the left-hand side of other assignments.

[source,xtext]
----
ConstStatement returns VariableStatement: 'const' varDecl+=ConstDeclaration ( ',' varDecl+=ConstDeclaration )* Semi;

ConstDeclaration returns VariableDeclaration: typeRef=TypeRef? name=IDENTIFIER const?='=' expression=AssignmentExpression;
----

[discrete]
==== Semantics [[const-semantics]]

A const variable statement is more or less a normal variable statement (see <<_variable-statement>>), except that all variables declared by that
statement are not writable (cf. <<Req-IDE-121>>).
This is similar to constant data fields (cf. <<_assignment-modifiers>>).

.Writability of const variables
[req,id=IDE-133,version=1]
--
All variable declarations of a const variable statement
$constStmt$ are not writeable:
$\forall vdecl \in constStmt.varDecl: \lnot vdecl.writable$
--

[[_for-of-statement]]
=== `for ... of` statement

ES6 introduced a new form of `for` statement: `for ... of` to iterate over the elements of an  `Iterable`, cf. <<_iterablen>>.

[discrete]
==== Syntax [[for-of-statement-syntax]]

See <<_iteration-statements>>

[discrete]
==== Semantics [[for-of-statement-semantics]]

.for ... of statement
[req,id=IDE-134,version=1]
--
For a given $f$ the following conditions must hold:

1.  The value provided after `of` in a `for ... of` statement must be a subtype of `Iterable<?>`.
2.  Either a new loop variable must be declared or an rvalue must be provided as init expression: +
$f.varDecl \neq null \lor (f.initExpr \neq null \land isRValue(f.initExpr))$
3.  If a new variable $v$ is declared before `of` and it has a declared type $T$, the value provided after must be a subtype of `Iterable<?extendsT>`.
If $v$ does not have a declared type, the type of $v$ is inferred to the type of the first type argument of the actual type of the value provided after `of`.
4.  If a previously-declared variable is referenced before with a declared or inferred type of $T$, the value provided after `of` must be a subtype of `Iterable<?extendsT>`.

NOTE: `Iterable` is structurally typed on definition-site so non-N4JS types can meet the above requirements by simply implementing the only method in interface `Iterable` (with a correct return type).

NOTE: The first of the above constraints (the type required by the ’of’ part in a `for ... of` loop is `Iterable`) was changed during the definition of ECMAScript 6.
This is implemented differently in separate implementations and even in different versions of the same implementation (for instance in different versions of V8).
Older implementations require an `Iterator` or accept both `Iterator` an or `Iterable`.

Requiring an `Iterable` and not accepting a plain `Iterator` seems to be the final decision (as of Dec. 2014).
For reference, see abstract operations `GetIterator` in cite:[ECMA15a(S7.4.2)] and "CheckIterable" cite:[ECMA15a(S7.4.1)] and their
application in "ForIn/OfExpressionEvaluation" cite:[ECMA15a(S13.6.4.8)] and `CheckIterable` and their application in `ForIn/OfExpressionEvaluation`.
See also a related blog post footnote:[available at: http://www.2ality.com/2013/06/iterators-generators.html] that is kept up to date with changes to ECMAScript 6:

[quote]
_ECMAScript 6 has a new loop, for-of. That loop works with iterables. Before we can use it with createArrayIterator(), we need to turn the result into an iterable._

An array or object destructuring pattern may be used left of the `of`.
This is used to destructure the elements of the `Iterable` on the right-hand side (not the `Iterable` itself).
For detais, see <<_array-and-object-destructuring>>.

--

=== Import Statement

Cf. ES6 import cite:[ECMA15a(15.2.2)], see also https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/modules/

[discrete]
==== Syntax [[import-statement-syntax]]

The grammar of import declarations is defined as follows:

[source,xtext]
----
ImportDeclaration:
    {ImportDeclaration}
    ImportDeclarationImpl
;

fragment ImportDeclarationImpl*:
    'import' (
        ImportClause importFrom?='from'
    )? module=[types::TModule|ModuleSpecifier] Semi
;

fragment ImportClause*:
        importSpecifiers+=DefaultImportSpecifier (',' ImportSpecifiersExceptDefault)?

    |   '{' (importSpecifiers+=NamedImportSpecifier (',' importSpecifiers+=NamedImportSpecifier)* ','?)? '}'

NamedImportSpecifier:
        importedElement=[types::TExportableElement|BindingIdentifier<Yield=false>]
    |   importedElement=[types::TExportableElement|IdentifierName] 'as' alias=BindingIdentifier<Yield=false>
;

DefaultImportSpecifier:
    importedElement=[types::TExportableElement|BindingIdentifier<Yield=false>]
;

NamespaceImportSpecifier: {NamespaceImportSpecifier} '*' 'as' alias=BindingIdentifier<false> (declaredDynamic?='+')?;

ModuleSpecifier: STRING;
----

These are the properties of import declaration which can be specified by the user:


`annotations` ::
Arbitrary annotations, see <<Annotations>> and below for details.

`importSpecifiers` ::
The elements to be imported with their names.

////
%Properties set via annotations:
%\version{postponed}{Not currently implemented, will be implemented if needed}
%\begin{properties}
%\item [$exclude$ \annotationDef{@Exclude}; compiler instruction to exclude the particular dependency from the generated define() call, even if the dependency analyzer would add it.
%\item [$force$ \annotationDef{@Force}; compiler instruction to include the particular dependency from the generated define() call, even if the dependency analyzer would have removed it.
%\end{properties}
%note above (\annotationDef{@Exclude} and \annotationDef{@Force}) should be aligned with ES6 modules semantics
////

import {A as G} from "p/G"
import {A as H, B as I} from "p/H"
----
--

[discrete]
==== Semantics [[import-statement-semantics, Import Statement Semantics]]

Import statements are used to import identifiable elements from another module.
Identifiable elements are

* types (via their type declaration), in particular
** classifiers (classes, interfaces)
** functions
* variables and constants.

The module to import from is identified by the string literal following keyword `from`.
This string must be a valid

* complete module specifier footnote:[For more details on module specifiers, see <<_qualified-names>>.]:
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import {A} from "ProjectA/a/b/c/M"

----
* plain module specifier:
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import {A} from "a/b/c/M"

----
* or project name only, assuming the project defines a main module in its `package.json` file (using the `mainModule` package.json property, see <<package-json-mainModule>>):
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import {A} from "ProjectA"

----

For choosing the element to import, there are the exact same options as in ECMAScript6:

* named imports select one or more elements by name, optionally introducing a local alias:
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import {C} from "M"
    import {D as MyD} from "M"
    import {E, F as MyF, G, H} from "M"

----
* namespace imports select all elements of the remote module for import and define a namespace name; the imported elements are then accessed via the namespace name:
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import * as N from "M"
    var c: N.C = new N.C();

----
* default imports select whatever element was exported by the remote module as the default (there can be at most one default export per module):
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import C from "M"

----
* namespace imports provide access to the default export:
+
[source,n4js]
----
    import * as N from "M"
    var c: N.default = new N.default();

----
.Imports
[req,id=IDE-135,version=1]
--
The following constraints are defined on a (non-dynamic) import statement $i$:

* The imported module needs to be accessible from the current project.
* The imported declarations need to be accessible from the current module.

For named imports, the following constraints must hold:

* No declaration must be imported multiple times, even if aliases are used.
* The names must be unique in the module. They must not conflict with each other or locally declared variables, types, or functions.
* Declarations imported via named imports are accessible only via used name (or alias) and not via original name directly.

For wildcard imports, the following constraints must hold:

* Only one namespace import can be used per (target) module, even if different namespace name is used.
* The namespace name must be unique in the module. They must not conflict with each other or locally declared variables, types, or functions.
* Declarations imported via namespace import are accessible via namespace only and not with original name directly.

For namespace imports, the following constraints must hold:

* If the referenced module is a plain `js` file, a warning will be created to use the dynamic import instead.

For default imports, the following constraints must hold:

* The referenced module must have a default export.

Cross-cutting constraints:

* No declaration can be imported via named import and namespace import at the same time.

import E from 'E';//error, E/E is already imported as NE.E

import F from 'F';
import * as NF from 'F';//error, F/F is already imported as F
----

<<<

Names used in imports must not not conflict with each other or local
declarations:

[source,n4js]
----
import * as A from 'A1';
import * as A from 'A2';//A is already used as namespace for A1

import B from 'B1';
import B1 as B from 'B2';//B us already used as import B/B1

import C1 as C from 'C1';
import * as C from 'C2'; //C is already used as import C1/C1

import * as D from 'D1';
import D2 as D from 'D2';//D is already used as namespace for D1

import E from 'E';
var E: any; // conflict with named import E/E

import * as F from 'F';
var F: any; // conflict with namespace F
----

Using named imports, aliases and namespaces allows to refer to mulitple
types of the same name such as  `A/A`, `B/A` and `C/A`:

[source,n4js]
----
import A from 'A';// local name A referencess to A/A
import A as B from 'B';//local name B referencess to B/A
import * as C from 'C';//local name C.A referencess to C/A
----

<<<

If a declaration has been imported with an alias or namespace, it is not
accessible via its original name:

[source,n4js]
----
import * as B from 'A1';
import A2 as C from 'A2';

var a1_bad: A1;//error, A1/A1 is not directly accessible with original name
var a1_correct: B.A1;// A1/A1 is accessible via namespace B
var a2_bad: A2;//error, A2/A2 is not directly accessible with original name
var a2_correct: C;// A2/A2 is accessible via alias C

[[Dynamic_Imports]]
==== Dynamic Imports

N4JS extends the ES6 module import in order that modules without a `n4jsd` or `n4js` file (plain `js` modules) can be imported.
This is done by adding `+` to the name of the named import. This form of compile-time import without type information is not
to be confused with import calls as described in <<Import_Calls>>, which are sometimes referred to as "dynamic import" as well.

.Dynamic Import
[req,id=IDE-136,version=1]
--
Let $i$ be an import
statement $i$ with a dynamic namespace specifier. The
following constraints must hold:

1.  $i.module$ must not reference an `n4js` file.
2.  If $i.module$ references an `n4jsd` file, a warning is
to be created.
3.  If the file referenced by $i.module$ is not found, an
error is created just as in the static case.

These constraints define the error level when using dynamic import: we receive no error for `js`, a warning for `n4jsd`, and an error for `n4js` files.
The idea behind these distinct error levels is as follows: +
If only a plain `js` file is available, using the dynamic import is the only way to access elements from the `js` module.
This might be an unsafe way, but it allows the access and simplifies the first steps.
An `n4jsd` file may then be made available either by the developer using the `js` module or by a third-party library.
In this case, we do not want to break existing code.
There is only a warning created in the case of an available `n4jsd` file and a `js` file still must be provided by the user.
Having an `n4js` file is a completely different story; no `n4jsd` file is required, no `js` file is needed
(since the transpiler creates one from the `n4js` file) and there is absolutely no reason to use the module dynamically.

==== Immutabilaty of Imports


Imports create always immutable bindings, c.f.

http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-createimportbinding


.Immutable Import
[req,id=IDE-137,version=1]
--
Let $i$ be a binding to an imported element.
It is an error if

* $i$ occurs on the left-hand side as the assignment-target of an assignment expression (this also includes any level in a destructuring pattern on the left-hand side),
* $i$ as a direct argument of a postfix operator (`i++`/`i--`),
* $i$ as a direct argument of a `delete` operator,
* $i$ as a direct argument of the `increment` or `decrement` unary operator (`i++`/`i--`)

=== Export Statement


Cf. ES6 import cite:[ECMA15a(15.2.3)]

[discrete]
==== Syntax [[export-statement-syntax]]

Grammar of export declarations is defined as follows:

[source,xtext]
----
ExportDeclaration:
    {ExportDeclaration}
    ExportDeclarationImpl
;

fragment ExportDeclarationImpl*:
    'export' (
        wildcardExport?='*' ExportFromClause Semi
    |   ExportClause ->ExportFromClause? Semi
    |   exportedElement=ExportableElement
    |   defaultExport?='default' (->exportedElement=ExportableElement | defaultExportedExpression=AssignmentExpression<In=true,Yield=false> Semi)
    )
;

fragment ExportFromClause*:
    'from' reexportedFrom=[types::TModule|ModuleSpecifier]
;

fragment ExportClause*:
    '{'
        (namedExports+=ExportSpecifier (',' namedExports+=ExportSpecifier)* ','?)?
    '}'
;

ExportSpecifier:
    element=IdentifierRef<Yield=false> ('as' alias=IdentifierName)?
;

ExportableElement:
      N4ClassDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | N4InterfaceDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | N4EnumDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | ExportedFunctionDeclaration<Yield=false>
    | ExportedVariableStatement
;
----

These are the properties of export declaration, which can be specified by the user:

`exportedElement` ::
The element to be exported, can be a declaration or a variable/const statement.

.Export
[example]
====

[source,n4js]
----
export public class A{}
export interface B{}
export function foo() {}
export var a;
export const c="Hello";

==== Semantics [[export-statement-semantics]]

With regard to type inference, export statements are not handled at all.
Only the exported element is inferred and the `export` keyword is ignored.

In order to use types defined in other compilation units, these types have to be explicitly imported with an import statement.

Imported namespaces cannot be exported.

Declared elements (types, variables, functions) are usually only visible outside the declaring module if the elements are exported and imported (by the using module, cf. <<_import-statement>>).

Some special components (runtime environment and libraries, cf. <<_runtime-environment-and-runtime-libraries>>, may export elements globally.
This is done by annotating the export (or the whole module) with `@Global`, see <<_global-definitions>> for details.

By adding `default` after the keyword `export`, the identifiable element can be exported as ’the default’.
This can then be imported from other modules via default imports (see <<_import-statement>>).
