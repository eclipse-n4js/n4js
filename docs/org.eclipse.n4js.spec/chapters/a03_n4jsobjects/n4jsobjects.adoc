== Reflection Model




N4JS provided metadata for reflection (and introspection). This
information is available via instances of some reflection model classes
(described below) attached to types and (in some cases) functions.

The following class diagrams shows the defined classes. Note that for
performance reasons, the actual structure may vary from the model.

Remark: This section is work in progress. The final goal is to provide a
metamodel similar to Ecore, but we will only add new features if needed.

== Error Types

N4JS provides additional Error types as subtypes of `Error`.

[.language-n4js]
=== N4ApiNotImplemented


Considering API definitions and concrete implementations of those APIs
the error `N4-Api-Not-Implemented-Error` is introduced to specifically report missing implementations.
Instances of this error type are inserted internally during the
transpilation of API-implementing projects. Whenever a difference to the
API in form of a missing implementation is encountered, the transpiler
will insert stub-code throwing an instance of `N4-Api-Not-Implemented-Error`.

API-testing projects can catch those errors and act accordingly. This
enables tracking of completeness of implementations by counting the
occasions an `N4-Api-NotImplemented-Error` was encountered.
