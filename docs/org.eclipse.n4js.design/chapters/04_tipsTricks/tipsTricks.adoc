= Tips and Tricks
:find:

In this chapter we collect some coding hints and guidelines on how to properly use the APIs of Eclipse, EMF, Xtext and
other dependencies we are using, as well as our own utilities and helpers.

This chapter is only about coding; add information on things like Eclipse setup or Maven/Jenkins to one of the preceding
chapters. Similarly, this chapter is intended to provide just a quick overview, check-list and reminder; add detailed
information and diagrams to one of the succeeding chapters.


== Versioning

The rule of thumb for configuring the version increments through file `version.json` is as follows:

* when introducing non-breaking changes in the n4js-libs, nothing has to be changed in `version.json`;
  (version increments will be computed automatically by incrementing the patch segment).
* when introducing breaking changes in the n4js-libs, edit file `version.json` to request an
  increment of the major/minor segment.
* in case of breaking changes ONLY in the core language (IDE or headless builder), we do not yet
  increment any versions (except updating time stamps which is done automatically), so file
  `version.json` does not have to be changed in this case.

For details, including how to configure a pre-release tag / dist-tag for publishing for testing
purposes, see <<sec:versioning>>.


== Naming

* The internal handling of N4JS project names is non-trivial (due to the support for npm scopes), see
  API documentation of `ProjectDescriptionUtils#isProjectNameWithScope(String)` for a detailed overview.
  In short:
** `IN4JSProject#getProjectName()` and `IProject#getName()` return different values!
** Avoid using the Eclipse project name, i.e. the return value of `IProject#getName()`, as far as possible
   (only use it in UI code when actually dealing with what is shown in the Eclipse UI).
** The last segment of an URI or path pointing to an N4JS project is *not* always the project name; use
   utilities in `ProjectDescriptionUtils` instead, e.g. `#deriveN4JSProjectNameFromURI()`!
   (However, given an URI or path pointing to a file inside an N4JS project, you can use its last segment
   to obtain the file name.)


== Logging
In many situations developer needs to use some kind of logging. When in need, follow these rules:

. Use `org.apache.log4j.Logger;` for logging. Other logging utilities (like java built in logger) are not configured.
. do not use `System.out` nor `Sysetem.err` for logging. It is ok to use it for debugging purposes, but those calls
should never be merged to master. _(with exception of headless compiler, which uses them explicitly)_
. There is central logger configuration in `org.eclipse.n4js.utils.logging` (and `org.eclipse.n4js.utils.logging`) that should 
be used
.. `log4j.xml` used for production
.. `log4j_tests.xml` used when running tests
. in Eclipse run configurations logger has to be set properly, e.g.
`log4j.configuration=file:${workspace_loc:org.eclipse.n4js.utils.logging/log4j_tests.xml}`
. in maven configurations logger has to be set separately, e.g.
`-Dlog4j.configuration="file:${basedir}/../../plugins/org.eclipse.n4js.utils.logging/log4j_tests.xml`


== Cancellation Handling

At various occasions, Xtext provides an instance of class `CancelIndicator` to allow our code to handle cancellation of
long-running task.

Some things to keep in mind:

* whenever a `CancelIndicator` is available any code that might not return immediately should implement proper
  cancellation handling (as explained in the next items).
* most importantly: reacting to a cancellation by returning early from a method is an anti-pattern that leads to
  problems (client code might continue work on a canceled and thus invalid state); instead: throw an
  `OperationCanceledException`!
* don't use `CancelIndicator#isCanceled()` for cancellation handling, except in certain special cases. A valid exception
  case might be during logging to show a message like "operation was canceled".
* instead, inject the Xtext service called `OperationCanceledManager` and invoke its method `#checkCanceled()`, passing-in
  the cancel indicator (this method is null-safe; it will throw an `OperationCanceledException` in case a cancellation has
  occurred). Don't directly create and throw an `OperationCanceledException` yourself.
* use the other methods provided by `OperationCanceledManager` when appropriate (see code of that class for details).
* in try/catch blocks, when catching exceptions of a super type of `OperationCanceledException`, be sure to *not suppress*
  cancellation exceptions. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
// Java code
@Inject private OperationCanceledManager operationCanceledManager;
/** Returns true on success, false otherwise. */
public boolean doSomething(CancelIndicator ci) {
  try {
    // do something that might be canceled
    return true;
  } catch(Exception e) {
    operationCanceledManager.propagateIfCancelException(e); // <- IMPORTANT!
    return false;
  }
}
----
+
Try/finally blocks, on the other hand, do not need any special handling.
* a cancel indicator can also be stored in the rule environment (see `RuleEnvironmentExtensions#addCancelIndicator()`). This
  means:
** if you create a rule environment completely from scratch and you have a cancel indicator at hand, add it to the rule
  environment via `RuleEnvironmentExtensions#addCancelIndicator()` (not required when using `RuleEnvironmentExtensions#wrap()` for
  deriving a rule environment from an existing one).
** if you have a rule environment available, be sure to use its cancel indicator in long-running operations, i.e. with
  code like:
+
[source,java]
----
// Xtend code
import static extension org.eclipse.n4js.typesystem.utils.RuleEnvironmentExtensions.*
class C {
  @Inject private OperationCanceledManager operationCanceledManager;
  def void doSomething() {
    for(a : aLotOfStuff) {
      operationCanceledManager.checkCanceled(G.cancelIndicator);
      // main work ...
    }
  }
----


== Caching
* Caching of external libraries (implemented in ExternalProjectMappings)
** update _only_ using `EclipseExternalLibraryWorkspace#updateState()`
** always mind that the diff of current state and cached state is a necessary information for cleaning dependencies of removed npms
*** see `EclipseExternalIndexSynchronizer#synchronizeNpms()` for implementation
** updating also happens when external root locations change (see ExternalIndexUpdater)
* Caching of user workspace projects (implemented in MuliCleartriggerCache)
** caches only some project information and should be refactored along with Core, Model and EclipseBasedN4JSWorkspace

== Dependency Injection

There are some things to keep in mind when using dependency injection in the context of Xtext. This is a longer topic and it is discussed in the appendix
<<sec:XtextInjection>>.

== Miscellaneous
* Resource load states: when an N4JS/N4JSD file is loaded, a certain sequence of processing is triggered (parsing,
  linking, validation, etc.) and thus an `N4JSResource` transitions through a sequence of "load states". For details,
  see <<sec:N4JS_Resource_Load_States>>.
