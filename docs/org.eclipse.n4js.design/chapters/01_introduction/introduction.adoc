This document describes design aspects of the N4JS compiler and IDE. It relies on the following N4JS related specifications:

* N4JS Language Specification cite:[N4JSSpec]

We reuse the notation specified in cite:[N4JSSpec].



[[sec:IDE_Overview]]
== IDE Components

The N4JS and N4JSIDE components are organized via features. The following features with included plugins are defined 
(the common prefix "org.eclipse.n4js" is omitted at the plugin name):

[[sec:Naming_Conventions]]
=== Naming Conventions

In the above sections, tests were omitted. We use the following naming conventions (by example) for test and tests helper:

[horizontal]
project:: -
project.tests::
  tests for project, is a fragment
project.tests.helper::
  helper classes used ONLY by tests
project.tests.performance::
  performance tests
project.tests.integration::
  integration tests
project.ui:: -
project.ui.tests::
  tests for ui project, fragment of project.ui
project.ui.tests.helper::
  helper classes used ONLY by tests
project.ui.tests.performance:: -
tests.helper::
  general test helper
ui.tests.helper::
  general ui test helper
project.xpect.tests::
  xpect tests for the project, despite dependnecies to UI the can be executed as plain JUnit tests
project.xpect.ui.tests::
  xpect tests for the project, need to be executed as eclipse plugin tests


Due to Maven, tests are in subfolder tests (incl. helpers), implementation bundles in plugins, and release engineering related bundles in releng.
