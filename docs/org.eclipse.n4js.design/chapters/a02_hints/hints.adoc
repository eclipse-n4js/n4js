In this chapter, some tips and tricks regarding Eclipse, Xtend and Maven should be collected.

[[sec:XtextInjection]]
== Xtext Injection

<<fig:cd_XtextInjectors&gt;&gt; shows different injectors used by Xtext
and their relation to the injector of a custom language created with Xtext
(in this example N4JS).

[[fig:XtextInjectors]]

image::{find}images/cd_XtextInjectors.svg[title="Xtext injectors and custom DSL injector"]

*Injectors creation:*

* create 'SharedInjector'
** create shared singletons
* create (lazily) custom language injector
** take singletons from shared injector
** add bindings from 'SharedModule'
** create own singletons

Normally one injector is bound to one language.
'ContributingModule' allows custom languages to contribute bindings to the
shared state, effectively cross project boundaries.

It must be noted that in case of N4JS tools there are multiple languages
contributing / extending Xtext injector, which can be seen in figure
<<fig:cd_customInjectors&gt;&gt;

image::{find}images/cd_customInjectors.svg[title="Xtext injectors and custom DSL injector"]

[[sec:DI_MultipleInjectors_Singletons]]
=== Multiple Injectors and Singletons
Every injector creates its 'ObjectGraph'. Having multiple Injectors in
the system leads to multiple (disconnected) object graphs. For normal instances
that is not an issue, but for scoped instances this causes problems.
Most common issue happens with '@Singleton' instances that carry state.

[[fig:cd_SingletonDuplicate]]
[.center]
image::{find}images/cd_SingletonDuplicate.svg[title="Xtext injectors and custom DSL injector"]

<<fig:cd_customInjectors&gt;&gt; shows situation in which both 'ChildInjector'
and 'N4JSInjector' have their bindings for 'N4JSEclipseCore'. As a result those
injectors will create their instance of core that is expected to be
'@Singleton'. Additionally, this will be true for all its transitive
dependencies.

[[sec:DI_avoid_duplicate_singletons]]
==== Avoiding duplicate singletons

To avoid issue with duplicate singletons two distinct injectors should not
have their bindings for singletons. Developer needs to decide where to
define *the only* binding, and let one 'ObjectGraph' delegate to another.

[[sec:DI_binding_in_shared]]
===== Defining binding in the shared injector

One approach is to define binding in the shared injector. Then in the injector
of the custom language to delegate to the shared contribution.

[source]
----
/** Binds {@link IN4JSCore} */
public class ContributingModule implements Module {
    @Override
    public void configure(Binder binder) {
        binder.bind(IN4JSCore.class).to(IN4JSEclipseCore.class);
        binder.bind(IN4JSEclipseCore.class).to(N4JSEclipseCore.class).in(SINGLETON);
    }
}

/** Delegates binding for {@link IN4JSCore} to the shared provider. */
public class ContributingModule implements Module {
    public Provider<? extends IN4JSCore> bindIN4JSCore() {
        return Access.contributedProvider(N4JSEclipseCore.class);
    }
}
----

Downside of this approach is in the shared injector itself.
It does not allow for implicit bindings. This forces developer to declare
bindings for *all transitive* dependencies of the main binding explicitly.
Additionally, every custom language has to do it. These make shared injector
the _GodInjector_ that contains configuration for all custom languages,
it is responsible for creating most objects in the system, and potentially
exposes types from one language to another language where it might not be
desired.

[[sec:DI_binding_in_custom]]
===== Defining binding in the custom injector

Other approach is to define binding in the injector for a custom
language. Then let instances in the shared injector object graph to obtain
singleton instances via custom language injector (which is stored on the
custom language activator).

[source]
----
/** Does not bind {@link IN4JSCore} */
public class ContributingModule implements Module {
    @Override
    public void configure(Binder binder) {
        // no core binding
    }
}

/** Binds {@link IN4JSCore}. */
public class ContributingModule implements Module {
    public Class<? extends IN4JSCore> bindIN4JSCore() {
        return IN4JSEclipseCore.class;
    }
}

/** Some type used in shared injector object graph */
public SomeSharedType{

    /** Obtain {@link IN4JSCore} form {@code N4JSInjector}. */
    private IN4JSCore getIN4JSCore() {
        return N4JSActivator
                .getInstance()
                .getInjector(ORG_ECLIPSE_N4JS_N4JS)
                .getInstance(IN4JSCore.class);
    }
}
----

This approach also has downsides. In the 'SomeSharedType' that exists in the
shared injector object graph we cannot inject 'IN4JSCore' as it is not
known to the shared injector. Instead, we have to get the instance form the
'N4JSInjector' manually. This requires developer to know whole (singleton)
types structure
defined in every custom language.

[[sec:DI_custom_bundle]]
==== Use DI in custom bundle, use DI with extensions

[[sec:DI_custom_bundle_problem]]
===== Problem

DI should be used in a custom bundle, i.e. a bundle not generated by Xtext.
E.g., a new handler should be provided in its plugin, and this handler requires
an injected instance. Example

my.dsl.bundle.ui xtext generated

my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui
The following class is contained in my custom plugin:

[source]
----
class my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.Handler {
    @Inject SomeDSLOrXtextSpecificType obj;
}
----

The question is, how can obj of type be injected at this location?

[[sec:DI_custom_bundle_solution]]
===== Solution

First of all, to use DI in a type, the type instance itself must have been
created via DI. This requires an injector which uses the same class loader as
the type using the injector. This means that a new bundle needs its injector,
created by an IExecutableExtensionFactory using the bundles' activator (plugin)
singleton.

This activator can extend the generated activator of a Xtext bundle. The
following code can be used as a template, as long as no custom non-default
bindings are to be added (in this case, have a look at the generated activator
and override the methods configuring the injector):

[source]
----
public class my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.Activator extends my.dsl.bundle.ui.MyDSLActivator {
    private static my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.Activator INSTANCE;

    @Override
    public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        super.start(context);
        INSTANCE = this;
    }

    @Override
    public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
        INSTANCE = null;
        super.stop(context);
    }

    public static TypePopupActivator getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}
----

Additionally, a custom 'AbstractGuiceAwareExecutableExtensionFactory' has to be
implemented. This class then uses the new activator instance (this is required
as bundles have their classloaders!)

[source]
----
public class my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.SubExecutableExtensionFactory extends AbstractGuiceAwareExecutableExtensionFactory {
    @Override
    protected Bundle getBundle() {
        return my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.Activator.getInstance().getBundle();
    }

    @Override
    protected Injector getInjector() {
    return my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.Activator.getInstance().getInjector(MyDSLActivator.MY_LANGUAGE_GRAMMAR);
    }
}
----

Now, we can use this extension factory in the plugin.xml of the sub bundle to
let the handler be created via DI. E.g.

[source]
----
"org.eclipse.ui.handlers"&gt;
<handler
class="my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.SubExecutableExtensionFactory:my.dsl.bundle.sub.ui.Handler"
commandId="..."&gt;
handler&gt;
extension&gt;
----

[[sec:Access_Other_DSL_Injector]]
==== How do I get the Guice Injector of my language?

We have the use case to load a N4MF file inside the N4JS infrastructure to read
out the project description and configure the qualified names and container
visibility. I.e. we have to load another DSL in our current DSL infrastructure,
in the use case to have a Xtext resource set available to load the N4MF file.
Injecting the Xtext resource of the current DSL wouldnâ€™t work as it has not the
N4MF injection context. So in the following the ways how to access this
injection context is described as extracted from
http://koehnlein.blogspot.de/2012/11/xtext-tip-how-do-i-get-guice-injector.html[this blog post].

[[sec:DSL_Injector_UI_context]]
===== UI context

To access another DSL injector in a UI DSL project just add a dependency to the
UI project of the other DSL and then

[source]
----
MyClass myClass =
TheOtherDSLActivator.getInstance().getInjector().get(MyClass.class)
----

[[sec:DSL_Injector_Non_UI_context]]
===== Non UI context but with injection context

[source]
----
@Inject IResourceServiceProvider.Registry serviceProviderRegistry;
...
MyClass myClass
=
serviceProviderRegistry.getResourceServiceProvider(URI.createFileURI(n4mfFileAbsolutePath)).get(MyClass.class)
----

[[sec:DSL_Injector_Non_UI_non_injection_context]]
===== Non UI context without injection context

[source]
----
@Inject IResourceServiceProvider.Registry serviceProviderRegistry;
...
MyClass
myClass
=
IResourceServiceProvider.Registry.INSTANCE.getResourceServiceProvider(uri).get(MyClass.class);
----

[[sec:Cancel_Indicator]]
==== How do I get cancel indicators in different contexts?

Several factors contribute to responsiveness in the IDE, but here we focus in
running jobs in the background and reacting to cancellation requests.

The Eclipse Jobs API is recommended for potentially long-running tasks (other
than incremental building, which has dedicated support). For example, the
outline view is populated by a background job, running validations on the
resource (and honoring cancellation requests initiated as for any job).

Cancel indicators are a Xtext abstraction while Eclipse favors progress
monitors, the latter including not only cancellation capability but also a
callback mechanism to give feedback in the UI about intermediate progress.
Cancel indicator can wrap a progress monitor.

Cancel indicators come in two variants, depending on the source of cancellation
events:

* a resource becoming stale (usually as a result of editing sources) triggers
cancellation. These cancel indicators can be obtained via
'OutdatedStateManager', which itself is available via injection.
* cancel indicators associated to the UI, for example associated to an Eclipse
job. Examples:
** for an outline view running in the background, an override of method
'createRoot()' from 'DefaultOutlineTreeProvider' receives a UI-aware cancel
indicator;
** for the transpiler, instances that carry cancel indicator are
'IFileSystemAccess' and (in the future) 'IGenerator2'. To track the latter, see
Eclipse bug 477068.

In general, whenever a resource is validated cancel indicator should be checked
periodically. These checks are performed automatically via
'MethodWrapperCancelable' before the (reflective) invocation of each validation
method and therefore require no manual intervention, see
'AbstractMessageAdjustingN4JSValidator'. However, that doesnâ€™t help in case a
single validation method ''takes too long''. To simplify those checks, utility
'isCanceled()' of 'AbstractMessageAdjustingN4JSValidator' can be invoked.

[[sec:Show_Xtext_Index]]
=== Show the current Xtext index

Press the following keyboard shortcut in the running UI: kbd:[CTRL] +
kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[F3] (likely under Mac kbd:[CMD] + kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[F3]).

[[sec:Plugin_spy]]
=== Plug-in spy

Not special for Xtext but very helpful do identify which class implements a UI
concept, for example, if you want to know which class implements the Open Model
Element dialog just press kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[F3] to open that
dialog and afterwards press kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[ALT] + kbd:[F1] to show that
'XtextEObjectSearchDialog' is used as implementation. Additionally, use
kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[ALT] + kbd:[F2] to spy buttons in the toolbar and
kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[ALT] + kbd:[F3] to spy the extension point name of the
currently active view or window.
