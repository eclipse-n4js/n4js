[.language-n4js]
== Type Model and Grammar

The type model is used to define actual types and their relations (meta-model is defined by means of Xcore in file `Types.xcore`)
and also references to types (meta-model in `TypeRefs.xcore`). The type model is built via the `N4JSTypesBuilder` when a resource
is loaded and processed, and most type related tasks work only on the type model. Some types that are (internally) available
in N4JS are not defined in N4JS, but instead in a special, internal type language not available to N4JS developers, called N4TS
and defined in file `Types.xtext`.

The types are referenced by AST elements; vice versa the AST elements can be referenced from the types (see `SyntaxRelatedTElement`).
This backward reference is a simple reference to an EObject.

[[sec:Type_Model_Overview]]
=== Type Model Overview

The following figure, <<fig:cd_typeAndTypeRefHierarchy,Types and Type References>>, shows the classes of the type model and their inheritance relations, both the actual type definitions as defined in `Types.xcore` and the type references defined in `TypeRefs.xcore`. The most important type reference is the `ParameterizedTypeRef`; it is used for most user-defined references, for both parameterized and non-parameterized references. In the latter case, the list of type arguments is empty.

[[fig:cd_typeAndTypeRefHierarchy]]
image::{find}images/cd_typeModelHierarchy_allInOne.png[title="Type Model Overview: Types in the upper half and Type References in the lower half."]

Most types are self-explanatory. `TypeDefs` is the container element used in N4TS. Note that not all types and properties of types are available in N4JS – some can only be used in the N4TS language or be inferred by the type system for internal purposes. Some types need some explanation:

* `TObjectPrototype`: Metatype for defining built-in object types such as `Object` or `Date`, only available in N4TS.
* `VirtualBaseType`: This type is not available in N4JS. It is used to define common properties provided by all types of a certain metatype. E.g., it is used for defining some properties shared by all enumerations (this was the reason for introducing this type).

We distinguish four kinds of types as summarized in <<tab:KindOfTypes,Kind Of Types>>. Role is an internal construct for different kind of users who can define the special kind of type. The language column refers to the language used to specify the type; which is either N4JS or N4TS.

[[sec:Built_in_Types]]
=== Built-in and Primitive Types

The built-in and primitive types are not defined by the user, i.e. N4JS programmer. Instead, they are defined in special
internal files using the internal N4TS language: `builtin_js.n4ts`, `builtin_n4.n4ts`, `primitives_js.n4ts`, `primitives_n4.n4ts`.


[[sec:Type_Model_DSL]]
[.language-n4js]
=== Type Model DSL

For defining built-in types and for tests, a special DSL called N4TS is provided by means of an Xtext grammar and generated
tools. The syntax is similar to n4js, but of course without method or function bodies, i.e. without any statements of expressions.
The grammar file is found in `Types.xtext`.

The following list documents some differences to N4JS:

.  access modifiers directly support ``Internal``, so no annotations are needed (nor supported) here.
.  besides N4 classifiers such as classes, the following classifiers can be defined:
..  `object` define classes derived from object (predefined object types) Special features:
+
[horizontal]
indexed::
  defined what type is returned in case of index access
..  `virtualBase` virtual base types for argument
.  `primitive` primitive types (number, string etc.) Special features:
+
[horizontal]
indexed::
  defined what type is returned in case of index access
autoboxedType::
  defines to which type the primitive can be auto boxed
assignmnentCompatible::
  defines to which type the primitive is assignment compatible
.  types `any`, `null`, `void`, `undefined` – special types.

Annotations are not supported in the types DSL.


[[sec:Type_System_Implementation]]
[.language-n4js]
== Type System Implementation

The bulk of the type system's functionality is implemented in packages `org.eclipse.n4js.typesystem[.constraints|.utils]`.
Client code, e.g. in validations, should only access the type system through the facade class `N4JSTypeSystem`.
Each of the main type system functions, called "judgments", are implemented in one of the concrete subclasses of
base class `AbstractJudgment`. Internally, the type system is using a constraint solver for various purposes;
entry point for this functionality is class `InferenceContext`. All these classes are a good entry point into
the code base, for investigating further details.

Some type information is cached (e.g., the type of an expression in the AST) and the above facade will take care
to read from the cache instead of re-computing the information every time, as far as possible. This type cache is
being filled in a dedicated phase during loading and processing of an N4JS resource;
see <<sec:Type_Inference_combined_with_AST_Traversal>> and <<sec:N4JS_Resource_Load_States>> for details.


[[sec:Type_Inference_combined_with_AST_Traversal]]
[.language-n4js]
== Type Inference of AST

Most judgments provided by the facade `N4JSTypeSystem` and implemented by subclasses of `AbstractJudgment` are used
ad-hoc whenever client code requires the information they provide. This is applied, in particular, to judgments

* ``subtype``
* ``substTypeVariables``
* ``upperBound`` / ``lowerBound``

For judgment ``type`` footnote:[Currently only for [language-n4js]``type``, not for [language-n4js]``expectedType``,
but this may be changed in a future, further refactoring.], however, the processing is very different: we make
sure that the entire AST, i.e. all typable nodes of the AST, will be typed up-front in a single step, which
takes place during the _post-processing step_ of an N4JSResource (see <<sec:N4JS_Resource_Load_States>>), which
also has a couple other responsibilities. By triggering post-processing when client code invokes the type judgment
for the first time for some random AST node (at the latest; usually it is triggered earlier), we make sure that
this sequence is always followed.

The remainder of this section will explain this single-step typing of the entire AST in detail.


[[sec:Type_Inference_combined_with_AST_Traversal__Background]]
=== Background

Originally, the N4JS type system could be called with any `EObject` at any given time, without any knowledge of the
context. While this looked flexible in the beginning, it caused severe problems solving some inference cases, e.g.,
the rule environment had to be prepared from the outside and recursion problems could occur, and it was also
inefficient because some things had to be recalculated over and over again (although caching helped).

It is better to do type inferencing (that is, computing the type of expressions in general) in a controlled manner.
That is, instead of randomly computing the type of an expression in the AST, it is better to traverse the AST in a
well-defined traversal order. That way, it is guaranteed that certain other nodes have been visited and, if not,
either some special handling can kick in or an error can be reported. This could even work with XSemantics and the
declarative style of the rules. The difference is that by traversing the AST in a controlled manner, the rules can
make certain assumptions about the content of the rule-environment, such as that it always contains information
about type variable bindings and that it always contains information about expected types etc.

In that scenario, all AST nodes are visited and all types (and expected types) are calculated up-front. Validation
and other parts then do not need to actually compute types (by calling the actual, Xsemantics-generated type system);
instead, at that time all types have already been calculated and can simply be retrieved from the cache (this is
taken care of by the type system facade `N4JSTypeSystem`).

This also affects scoping, since all cross-references have to be resolved in this type computation step. However,
even for scoping this has positive effects: E.g., the receiver type in property access expressions is always visited
_before_ visiting the selector. Thus it is not necessary to re-calculate the receiver type in order to perform scoping
for the selector.

The above refactoring was done in summer 2015. After this refactoring, we are still using Xsemantics to compute the
types, i.e. the ``type``     judgement in Xsemantics was largely kept as before. However, the type judgment is invoked
in a controlled traversal order for each typable AST node in largely one step (controlled by `ASTProcessor` and `TypeProcessor`).

The upshot of this one-step type inference is that once it is completed, the type for every typable AST node is known.
Instead of storing this information in a separate model, this information will be stored and persisted in the type model
directly, as well as in transient fields of the AST footnote:[This is not yet implemented as of September 2015; types
are still stored in a separate cache, the `ASTMetaInfoCache`.]. Currently, this applies only to types, not expected types;
the inference of expected types could / should be integrated into the one-step inference as part of a future, further
refactoring.

[[sec:Triggering_Type_Inference_of_AST]]
=== Triggering

The up-front type inference of the entire AST is part of the post-processing of every N4JSResource and is thus
triggered when post-processing is triggered. This happens when

1.  someone directly calls ``pass:[#performPostProcessing()]`` on an N4JSResource
2.  someone directly calls ``pass:[#resolveAllLazyCrossReferences()]`` on an N4JSResource,
//
3.  EMF automatically resolves the first proxy, i.e. someone calls an EMF-generated getter for a value that is a proxy,
4.  someone asks for a type for the first time, i.e. calls ``N4JSTypeSystem#type()``,
5.  ...

Usually this happens after the types builder was run with `preLinking==false` and before validation takes place.
For details, see classes `PostProcessingAwareResource` and `N4JSPostProcessor`.


[[sec:Traversal_Order_During_Type_Inference_of_AST]]
=== Traversal Order

The traversal order during post-processing is a bit tricky, as some things need to be done in a top-down order (only
few cases, for now footnote:[In the future, the top-down order could become more important if inference of _expected_
types is also integrated into post-processing.]), others in a bottom-up order (e.g. the main typing of AST nodes),
and there is a third case in which several AST nodes are processed together (constraint-based type inference).

Figure <<fig:traversalOrder>> provides an example of an AST and shows in which order the nodes are processed. Green
numbers represent top-down processing, red numbers represent bottom-up processing and blue numbers represent the
processing of the surrounding yellow nodes in a single step.

[[fig:traversalOrder]]
image::{find}images/traversalOrder.png[title="Order in which AST nodes are being processed during post-processing."]

In the code, this is controlled by class `ASTProcessor`. The two main processing methods are

* ``pass:[#processNode_preChildren()]``, which will be invoked for all AST nodes in a top-down order (so top-down processing should be put here),
* ``pass:[#processNode_postChildren()]``, which will be invoked for all AST nodes in a bottom-up order (so bottom-up processing should be put here).

The common processing of groups of adjacent yellow nodes (represented in the figure by the two yellow/brown
triangles) is achieved by `PolyProcessor` telling the `TypeProcessor` to

. ignore certain nodes (all yellow nodes) and
. invoke method ``pass:[PolyProcessor#inferType()]`` for the root yellow node in each group (only the root!).
.
For details, see the two methods ``pass:[#isResponsibleFor()]`` and ``pass:[#isEntryPoint()]`` in ``PolyProcessor``.


[[sec:Cross_References_During_Type_Inference_of_AST]]
=== Cross-References

While typing the entire AST, cross-references need special care. Three cases of cross-references need to be distinguished:

[horizontal]
backward reference::
= cross-reference within the same file to an AST node that was already processed
** always legal
** processing: simply read the type from the cache that is currently being filled
forward reference::
= cross-reference within the same file to an AST node that was not yet processed
** usually illegal +
exception: legal if reference points to an _identifiable subtree_ (a subtree of an AST with an identifiable element at its root)
** processing: forward process the identifiable subtree and report back the type of its root
references to other files::
** always legal, because they can, by nature, only point to an identifiable subtree in the other file's AST
** processing: either ...
*** read type from TModule obtained from index (if available), or
*** load other file from source, trigger its post-processing (if not in progress or completed already), forward process the identifiable subtree (if not processed already) and report back the type of its root.

Note that for references to an ancestor (upward references) or successor (downward references) within an AST, the
classification as a forward or backward reference depends on whether we are in top-down or bottom-up processing.
Figure <<fig:upwardDownward,Upward Downward>> illustrates this: the left and right side show the same AST but on the
left side we assume a top down processing whereas on the right we assume a bottom up processing. On both sides,
backward references are shown in green ink (because they are unproblematic and always legal) and forward references
are shown in red ink. Now, looking at the two arrows pointing from a node to its parent, we see that it is classified
as a backward reference on the left side (i.e. top down case) but as a forward reference on the right side (i.e. bottom
down case). Conversely, an arrow from a node to its child is classified as a forward reference on the left side and as
a backward reference on the right side. Arrows across subtrees, however, are classified in the same way on the left and
right side (see the horizontal arrows at the bottom).

[[fig:upwardDownward]]
image::{find}images/upwardDownward.png[title="Backward and forward references in top-down and bottom-up processing."]


[[sec:Function_Accessor_Bodies_During_Type_Inference_of_AST]]
=== Function/Accessor Bodies

An important exception to the basic traversal order shown in Figure <<fig:traversalOrder>> is that the body of all
functions (including methods) and field accessors is postponed until the end of processing. This is used to avoid
unnecessary cycles during type inference due to a function's body making use of the function itself or some other
declarations on the same level as the containing function. For example, the following code relies on this:

[source,n4js]
----
let x = f();
function f(): X {
	if(x) {
		// XPECT noerrors --> "any is not a subtype of X." at "x"
		return x;
	}
	return new X();
}
----

Similar situation using fields and methods:

[source,n4js]
----
class C {
	d = new D();
	mc() {
		// XPECT noerrors --> "any is not a subtype of D." at "this.d"
		let tmp: D = this.d;
	}
}
class D {
	md() {
		new C().mc();
	}
}
----

For details of this special handling of function bodies, see method `ASTProcessor#isPostponedNode(EObject)` and field
`ASTMetaInfoCache#postponedSubTrees` and the code using it. For further investigation, change `isPostponedNode()` to always
return false and debug with the two examples above (which will then show the incorrect errors mentioned in the XPECT
comments) or run tests to find more cases that require this handling.


[[sec:Poly_Expressions_During_Type_Inference_of_AST]]
=== Poly Expressions

Polymorphic expressions, or _poly expressions_ for short, are expressions for which the actual type depends on the
expected type and/or the expected type depends on the actual type. They require constraint-based type inference
because the dependency between the actual and expected type can introduce dependency cycles between the types of
several AST nodes which are best broken up by using a constraint-based approach. This is particularly true when
several poly expressions are nested. Therefore, poly expressions are inferred neither in top-down nor in bottom-up
order, but all together by solving a single constraint system.

Only a few types of expressions can be polymorphic; they are called _poly candidates_: array literals, object literals,
call expressions, and function expressions. The following rules tell whether a poly candidate is actually poly:

* `ArrayLiteral` — always poly (because their type cannot be declared explicitly).
* `ObjectLiteral` — if one or more properties do not have a declared type.
* `CallExpression` — if generic & not parameterized.
* `FunctionExpression` — if return type or type of one or more formal parameters is undeclared.

This is a simplified overview of these rules, for details see method `pass:[#isPoly(Expression)]` in `AbstractPolyProcessor`.

The main logic for inferring the type of poly expressions is found in method `pass:[#inferType()]` in class `PolyProcessor`.
It is important to note that this method will only be called for root poly expressions (see above). In short, the basic
approach is to create a new, empty `InferenceContext`, i.e. constraint system, add inference variables and constraints for
the root poly expression and all its nested poly expressions, solve the constraint system and use the types in the solution
as the types of the root and nested poly expressions. For more details see method `pass:[#inferType()]` in class `PolyProcessor`.

So, this means that nested poly expressions do not introduce a new constraint system but instead simply extend their parent
poly’s constraint system by adding additional inference variables and constraints. *But not every nested expression that is
poly is a nested poly expression in that sense!* Sometimes, a new constraint system has to be introduced. For example:

* child poly expressions that appear as argument to a call expression are nested poly expressions (i.e. inferred in same constraint system as the parent call expression),
* child poly expressions that appear as target of a call expression are *not* nested poly expressions and a new constraint system has to be introduced for them.

For details see method `pass:[#isRootPoly()]` in `AbstractPolyProcessor` and its clients.

[[sec:Constraint_Solver_used_During_Type_Inference_of_AST]]
=== Constraint Solver

The simple constraint solver used by the N4JS type system, mainly for the inference of poly expressions, is implemented
by class `InferenceContext` and the other classes in package `org.eclipse.n4js.typesystem.constraints`.

The constraint solving algorithm used here is largely modeled after the one defined in ``The Java Language Specification 8``,
Chapter 18, but was adjusted in a number of ways, esp. by removing functionality not required for N4JS (e.g. primitive types,
method overloading) and adding support for specific N4JS language features (e.g. union types, structural typing).

For details see the API documentation of class `InferenceContext`.

[[sec:Structural_Typing]]
==  Structural Typing

Structural typing as an optional subtyping mode in N4JS is implemented in `StructuralTypingComputer`, activated depending on
the value of property `typingStrategy` in `ParameterizedTypeRef` and its subclasses.
