<h2 id="current-n4js-release" class="discrete">Current N4JS Release</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current release of N4JS, version 0.3, is a "public alpha".
What that implies:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are some known issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are probably a greater number of unknown issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be more features in future releases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There may be incompatible changes in future releases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Alpha" does not mean unstable. In fact, N4JS has been in development for three years.
There is already an extensive test suite with more that 70.000 tests including the
<a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262">ECMAScript test suites</a>. It has been in
use internally in production mode for more than a year, handling a code base with more
than 3.000 modules and many thousands of tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>N4JS has successfully passed its
internal beta phase: it&#8217;s working for us and, furthermore, we&#8217;re confident it will work
for you. Since every programmer has their own style, you may find issues we didn&#8217;t. We
may add new features or make changes in order to solve these particular issues. That&#8217;s
why we call it a "public alpha".</p>

<h2 id="known-issues"><a class="anchor" href="#known-issues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since we are using N4JS and the N4JS IDE internally for quite a while, we have found some
issues. There are still a lot of bugs open and we have plenty of ideas for new features.
We used an non-public bug tracking system to manage bugs internally. We will review and migrate
them to <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/n4js/issues">GitHub issues</a> as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="unknown-issues"><a class="anchor" href="#unknown-issues"></a>Unknown Issues</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>We embrace bug reports and feature requests.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the moment we use <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/n4js/issues">GitHub issues</a>
to manage issues found by public users. When we move to a different bug tracking system,
these issues shall be migrated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The N4JS IDE comes with special tool support for <a href="reporting-bugs.html#reporting_bugs">writing
bug reports</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-features"><a class="anchor" href="#new-features"></a>New Features</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the future, the following topics are expected to be addressed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved UI experience with a focus on customized content assist and quick-fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved ECMAScript 2015 support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved type inference and add type guards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved refactoring capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved Node.js developer experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for browser-based projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be other topics raised by users. Separating these topics into individual
features and prioritizing them will <strong>highly depend on your feedback</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="incompatible-changes-in-future-releases"><a class="anchor" href="#incompatible-changes-in-future-releases"></a>Incompatible Changes in Future Releases</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, this may happen. It&#8217;s quite possible that the language or APIs must be changed in
future releases, which could break existing code. This is no cause for concern, however.
As mentioned before, we have a substantial internal code base, so if incompatible changes
are introduced, we will provide tools to migrate your code automatically unless the changes
are easier to solve manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give you an idea of how this can happen: In earlier versions we used a Java-like syntax
for type annotations. Since this did not work well together with features such as async/await,
we changed the syntax to ECMAScript 4 colon style. This required our entire code base to be
reworked. Fortunately this was simple as we provided a quick-fix, enabling almost all problems
stemming from that change to be corrected with a single key stroke!</p>
