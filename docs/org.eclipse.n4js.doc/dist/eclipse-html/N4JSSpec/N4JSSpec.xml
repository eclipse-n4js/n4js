or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to

to distribute the Program, it is Recipient’s responsibility to acquire
that license before distributing the Program.</simpara>

<bridgehead xml:id="_4-commercial-distribution" renderas="sect3">4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</bridgehead>
<simpara>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
a commercial product offering, such Contributor (<literal>Commercial
Contributor</literal>) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (<literal>Indemnified Contributor</literal>) against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively <literal>Losses</literal>) arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor’s responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.</simpara>
<bridgehead xml:id="_5-no-warranty" renderas="sect3">5. NO WARRANTY</bridgehead>
<simpara>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
ON AN <literal>AS IS</literal> BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</simpara>
<bridgehead xml:id="_6-disclaimer-of-liability" renderas="sect3">6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</bridgehead>
<simpara>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</simpara>
<bridgehead xml:id="_7-general" renderas="sect3">7. GENERAL</bridgehead>
<simpara>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</simpara>
<simpara>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient’s patent(s), then such Recipient’s
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.</simpara>
<simpara>All Recipient’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient’s rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient’s
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</simpara>
<simpara>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</simpara>
<simpara>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="_introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>This specification defines the N4JS language.</simpara>
<simpara>In general, the N4JS JavaScript dialect used is identical to the standard ECMAScript as defined in the 6th edition of
ECMA-262, also known as ECMAScript 2015, referred to as [<link linkend="ECMA15a">ECMA15a</link>].</simpara>
<section xml:id="_notation" role="language-n4js">
<title>Notation</title>
<section xml:id="_grammar-notation">
<title>Grammar Notation</title>
<simpara>For the specification of the syntax and structure of elements, we use a
slightly augmented similar to the grammar language of Xtext <link xl:href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/301_grammarlanguage.html">Grammar Language</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Similar to [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a</link>], we define types with properties only for the purpose of explanation and usage within this specification.
We use the Xtext notation style to assign values to meta-properties.
Particularly, we use the Xtext notation for collection (<literal>+=</literal>) and boolean (<literal>?=</literal>) values.
These properties are written in italics. Enumerations are defined similar to Xtext.
In order to allow the specification of default values, which are often defined by omitting the value, we always define the literal explicitly if it can be defined by the user.</simpara>
<simpara>The following lists informally defines the grammar:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Terminal</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Terminals (or terminal strings) are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., <literal>terminal</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Enumerations</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Rules which contain only terminals used as values for properties are
marked with <literal>enum</literal> for enumeration.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Properties</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Values of non-terminals, e.g., other rules, can be assigned to
properties. The property name and the assignment are not part of the
original syntax and only used for the meta description. E.g., <literal><emphasis>name=</emphasis>Identifier</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Collection Properties</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>If a property is a collection, values are added to that list via <literal>+=</literal>.
E.g.,<literal><emphasis>property+=</emphasis>Value</literal> .</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Boolean Properties</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Boolean properties are set to false by default, if the value (usually
a terminal) is found, the boolean value is set to true. Often, the
name of the property is similar to the terminal. E.g., <literal><emphasis>final?</emphasis>='final'?</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>Properties of a non-terminal are sometimes listed again below the
grammar. In that case, often pseudo properties are introduced which are
derived from other properties and which are only used for
simplification.</simpara>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mfrac><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>B</mi><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>&lt;</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>:</mtext></mstyle><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mi>A</mi><mspace width="5.0mm"/><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>C</mi><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>&lt;</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>:</mtext></mstyle><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mi>B</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>C</mi><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>&lt;</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>:</mtext></mstyle><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mi>A</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>
<simpara><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>⊢</mo></math> is the context containing (bound) type variables etc., <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>⊢</mo></math> can be read as <literal>entails</literal>.
Thus, the rule can be read as follows:</simpara>
<blockquote>
<simpara>if the type B is a subtype of type A in context <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>Γ</mi></math> (i.e. with constraints on type variables specified in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>Γ</mi></math>), and if type C is a subtype of B, then C is also a subtype of A in context <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>Γ</mi></math>.</simpara>
</blockquote>
<simpara>In rules, we sometimes omit the environment if it is not needed.
New information is sometimes added to the environment, in particular, substitutions (that is binding type variables to a type).
The set of substitutions is written with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>θ</mi></math> (theta).
If new substitutions are explicitly added to that set, we write <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>θ</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>←</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfenced></math> (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>V</mi></math> is substituted with type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>T</mi></math>).
Often, these bindings are computed from a parameterized type reference which declares type arguments which are bound to the type variables of the generic declaration.
In this case we simply write <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>θ</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mi>p</mi></mfenced></math>, in which <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi></math> is the parameterized type declaration.
As these new substitutions must become part of a (newly) created environment, we then usually write <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>Γ</mi><mo>←</mo><mi>θ</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mi>p</mi></mfenced></math>.
These substitutions are usually omitted.</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Actual type: the actual type of a variable during runtime.

<simpara>These types are not type declarations but type references, in fact, as they may be parameterized.
For the sake of simplicity, we often omit the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>R</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>f</mi></math> suffix to shorten formulas.
Consequently, we define the following properties and pseudo properties for typed elements such as variables:</simpara>

<simpara>which binds a reference, i.e. an identifier, to a declaration (e.g.,variable declaration).</simpara>
<simpara>Binding of variable references to declaration is defined by ECMAScript already.
Type references only occur in type expressions, how these are handled is explained in <xref linkend="_type-expressions"/>.</simpara>
<simpara>We usually omit this binding mechanism in most rules and use the reference similarly to the declaration or definition it is bound to.
If a variable reference <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>r</mi></math>, for example, is bound to a variable declaration <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>D</mi></math>, i.e. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mi>r</mi><mi>D</mi></mfenced></math>, we simply write <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>r</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></math> instead of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mi>r</mi><mi>D</mi></mfenced><mo>,</mo><mi>D</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></math> to refer to the type expression

<simpara>The idea of this function is to remove duplicates.

<section xml:id="_logic-formulas">
<title>Logic Formulas</title>
<simpara>In general, we use a pragmatic mixture of pseudo code, predicate logic, and OCL.
Within constraints (also within the inference rules), the properties defined in the grammar are used.</simpara>
<simpara>In some rules, it is necessary to type the rule variables.
Instead of explicitly checking the metatype (via <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>μ</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mi>X</mi></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mi>:</mi><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow></math>), we precede the variable with the type, that is: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mi>X</mi></math>.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of "type casting" elements, often properties are simply accessed.
If an element does not define that element, it is either assumed to be false or null by default.</simpara>
<simpara>If a property <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi></math> is optional and not set, we write <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></math> to test its absence.
Note that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></math> is different from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>N</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></math>, as the latter refers to the null type.
Non-terminals may implicitly be subclasses.
In that case, the concrete non-terminal, or type, of a property may be subject for a test in a constraint.</simpara>

<title>Lexical Conventions</title>
<simpara>As a super language on top of ECMAScript, the same lexical conventions are supported as described in [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S7)</link>] within strict mode.
Some further constraints are defined, however, restricting certain constructs. These constraints are described in the following.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_identifier-names-and-identifiers">
<title>Identifier Names and Identifiers</title>
<simpara>Cf. [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S7.6)</link>], [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S11.1.2, p.p.63)</link>] and [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S01.2, p.p.51ff)</link>].</simpara>
<simpara>As a reminder, identifiers are defined as follows in the ECMAScript specification:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">IdentifierName: IdentifierStart* IdentifierPart;
IdentifierStart : UnicodeLetter | '_';
                \ UnicodeEscapeSequence</programlisting>
<simpara>N4JS supports a limited form of computed-names for member declarations:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">N4JSPropertyComputedName:
    '[' (SymbolLiteralComputedName | StringLiteralComputedName) ']'
;

SymbolLiteralComputedName: N4JSIdentifier '.' N4JSIdentifier ;

StringLiteralComputedName: STRING ;</programlisting>
<simpara>As can be seen, a computed-name must be either</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>a symbol reference, e.g., <literal>Symbol.iterator</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>a string literal, i.e., a compile time known constant.
This notation is useful when interoperating with libraries that define members whose names contain special characters (e.g., a field name starting with commercial-at)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In N4JS, identifiers are further constrained in order to avoid ambiguities and to make code more readable.
Some of these constraints will lead to errors, others only to warnings.
They do not apply for identifiers declared in definitions file (n4jsd) in order to enable declaration of external entities.</simpara>

<title>JSDoc</title>
<simpara>JSDoc are comments similar to JavaDoc in Java for documenting types, functions and members.
There is no semantic information expressed in JSDoc, that is, the behavior of a program must not change if all the JSDoc is removed.
The JSDoc tags and overall syntax is a mixture of tags defined by the <link xl:href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler">Google Closure Compiler</link>, Java&#8217;s <link xl:href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html">JavaDoc</link> tool and N4-specific tags.</simpara>
<simpara>JSDoc comments are multiline comments, starting with <literal>/**</literal> (instead of simple multiline comments, starting with <literal>/*</literal>).</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">MultiLineComment: '/*' MultiLineCommentChars? '*/'  // from ECMAScript specification
JSDoc:            '/**' MultiLineCommentChars? '*/'</programlisting>
<simpara>In general, JSDoc comments are placed directly before the annotated language element.
In some cases, this is slightly different, such as for method parameters, for example, where it is then explicitly specified.</simpara>
<simpara>The content of JSDoc comments will be covered in more detail in upcoming chapters.
For documentation purposes, multi- and single-line descriptions are used in several constructs.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis>Visibility</emphasis> defines the scope in which a declaration is visible, that is in which context references can be bound to the declaration.
<emphasis>Access control</emphasis> defines the extent to which types and members are accessible beyond their immediate context.
Access control may, therefore, restrict the visibility of a declaration by limiting its scope.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Extensibility</emphasis> refers to whether a given type can be subtyped, or in the case of members, whether they can be overridden.
Access control is a prerequisite for extensibility which is further explained in <xref linkend="_n4js-specific-classifiers"/></simpara>
<section xml:id="_access-control" role="language-n4js">
<title>Access Control</title>
<simpara>Types from one project may or may not be made accessible to another project.
Likewise, members from a given type may or may not be made accessible to members existing outside that type.
For example, if a developer writes an application which uses a library, which types within that library can the application see?
Given a type that is set as visible, which members of that type can the application see?</simpara>
<simpara>Accessing a type or member actually means that a reference is bound to a
declaration with the same identifier.</simpara>
<simpara>We distinguish the following contexts from which an element is accessed
as follows:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Module or type</emphasis>: access from elements in the same module or type.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Subtype</emphasis>: access from a subtype.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Project</emphasis>: access from the same project.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Vendor</emphasis>: access from different project of the same vendor.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">World</emphasis>: access from anything else.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Accessibility is defined by modifiers on types and members, e.g <literal>public</literal>, <literal>protected</literal>, <literal>project</literal>, <literal>private</literal>, via the <literal>export</literal> statement, and by the <literal>@Internal</literal> annotation.
Extensibility is defined by the <literal>@Final</literal> annotation respectively.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_accessibility-of-types-top-level-variables-and-function-declarations" role="language-n4js">
<title>Accessibility of Types, Top-Level Variables and Function Declarations</title>
<simpara>We define types (classes, interfaces, enums) whereby each type has members (fields and methods, depending on the kind of type).
When we define a type, we need to define whether it is visible only for the specifying module, project or whether that type should be accessible from outside of that project.</simpara>
<simpara>The same is true for variable declarations and function declarations defined as top-level elements of a module.</simpara>
<simpara>The following type access modifiers are supported by N4JS:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">enum TypeAccessModifier:      project
                            | public;</programlisting>
<simpara>If a type is not exported, its visibility is private.
If a type has declared visibility <literal>public</literal>, it may additionally be marked as internal via the annotation <literal>@Internal</literal>.
Thus, we have the following set of type access modifiers:</simpara>
<simpara>TAM = <literal>private</literal> <literal>project</literal> <literal>public@Internal</literal> <literal>public</literal></simpara>
<simpara>That is, in N4JS, only the type access modifiers and are available.
The redundant <literal>project</literal> modifier serves only documentation purpose and can be synthesized if the <literal>export</literal> modifier is preset.</simpara>
<simpara>All other modifiers used here are synthesized as shown in the next example:</simpara>

For example, if <literal>B extends A</literal>, and if <literal>A</literal> is not accessible to some client <literal>C</literal> but <literal>B</literal> is, then the members of <literal>A</literal> are indirectly accessible to <literal>C</literal> in so far as they are accessed via <literal>B</literal>.
This is true in particular for interfaces, as their properties are possibly merged into the consuming class (cf. <xref linkend="_implementation-of-members"/>).</simpara>
<simpara>The following member access modifiers are supported by N4JS:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">enum MemberAccessModifier:    private
                            | project
                            | protected
                            | public;</programlisting>
<simpara>The modifiers <literal>protected</literal> and <literal>public</literal> may be annotated with <literal>@Internal</literal>.
Thus, we can define the following set of member access modifiers:</simpara>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mtable><mtr><mtd><mi>M</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mspace width="3.0mm"/></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>private</mtext></mstyle><mo>,</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>protected@Internal</mtext></mstyle><mo>,</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>protected</mtext></mstyle><mo>,</mo></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>project</mtext></mstyle><mo>,</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>public@Internal</mtext></mstyle><mo>,</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>public</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mo>}</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>
<simpara><literal>protected@Internal</literal> and <literal>public@Internal</literal> are synthesized tags and were introduced as shorthand notation for the <literal>@Internal</literal> annotation together with <literal>protected</literal> or <literal>public</literal> access modifiers.
The <literal>project</literal> modifier is the default one and it can be omitted.
As with the type access modifiers, not all member access modifiers are available in N4JS.
Instead, they are synthesized from different construct as shown in the next example.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Synthesized Member Access Modifiers in N4JS</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">export @Internal public class C {

    private f0;                 // private
    f1;                         // project
    project f2;                 // project
    @Internal protected f3;     // protected@Internal
    protected f4;               // protected
    @Internal public f5;        // public@Internal
    public f6;                  // public

    private m0() {}             // private
    m1() {}                     // project
    project m2() {}             // project
    @Internal protected m3() {} // protected@Internal
    protected m4() {}           // protected
    @Internal public m5() {}    // public@Internal
    public  m6() {}             // public

<simpara>Private members of a classifier are visible and accessible within a module, i.e. you can access the private method of a class, for instance,
when the use of the class as receiver is in the same module where the class has been defined.
In case of inheritance, private members are visible if the host (e.g. the class) is in the same module as the provider (the extended class).
This also means that abstract members of a class are allowed to be defined private as they may be overridden within a module.</simpara>

<example>
<title>Type and Member Access Modifiers</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">export project interface I {
    project foo();

// This interface may be used publicly, but since the inherited method foo() is project visible only,
// it is not possible to implement that interface in other projects.
export public interface J extends I {

// Since the visibility of foo is set to public here, it is possible to implement this interface in other projects.
export public interface K extends I {

var c: C = C.instance();</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Members of non-visible types are, in general, not visible for a client.
Members may become visible, however, if they are accessed via a visible type which inherits these members.
The following examples demonstrate two different scenarios:</simpara>
<example>
<title>Declaring type vs receiver type</title>
<simpara>It is especially noteworthy that the declaring type of a member is
generally not considered for the accessibility of that member but only
the receiver type is relevant.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Base {
    public m(b: Base): void {}
}
export public class ApiType extends Base {
}</programlisting>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">import * as N from "Base";

var t = new N.ApiType();
// member can be accessed although type Base is not exported:
t.m(t);</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>The property access to the member <literal>m</literal> is valid because it fulfills the constraints for accessibility.
The receiver of the property access is <literal>t</literal> of type <literal>ApiType</literal>.
That type is exported and accessible.
Therefore, the inherited member <literal>m</literal> is also considered valid since it is also defined <literal>public</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>This rule allows for defining a common functionality in module or project visible types that becomes accessible via exported, visible subtypes.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Member Access and Type Access Interplay</title>
<simpara>The following example demonstrates the behavior when
non-visible types are used as return types. In this case, all the
members of the non-visible types are not accessible, even if they have a
public access modifier.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {
    foo(): void{}
}
export public class C {
    public getHidden(): A { return new A() };

<title>Qualified Names</title>
<simpara>In N4JS source code, types can only be referenced using their simple name.
There is no such thing as a fully-qualified type name in N4JS or ECMAScript.
Types are uniquely identified by their simple name, maybe together with an import and the module specifier given there.
Clashes between simple names of imported type and locally declared types can be resolved by importing the type under an alias.</simpara>
<simpara>In some cases, however, we need to define references to types or even members.
For example, if we want to reference certain members in JSDoc comments or for unambiguous error messages.
For this reason, we formally define qualified names even if they cannot occur in source code.</simpara>

<title>Name Duplicates</title>
<simpara>There might be cases where two (or more) scopes created by different entities with the same (simple) name overlap.
Those situations can be referred to as shadowing, hiding, or obscuring.
While they are not the same, many of those cases are not allowed in N4JS.
For simplicity we refer to them all as shadowing or duplication (see below).
Rule of thumb is that N4JS allows everything that is allowed in JavaScript StrictMode.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_lexical-environment">
<title>Lexical Environment</title>
<simpara>N4JS handles scopes similar to ECMAScript, so that function scope is applied to variables declared with <literal>var</literal> (and parameters), and block scope for variables is declared with <literal>let</literal> or <literal>const</literal>.
In general, ECMAScript defines <emphasis>Lexical Environments</emphasis> as a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.10.2)</link>].</simpara>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>Additionally, a built-in lexical environment that defines global scope exists for every <literal>Script</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Since N4JS is extended (and a bit more strict) JS strict mode, <emphasis>Object environment record</emphasis>s created by <literal>WithStatement</literal> are not taken into account when resolving duplicates.
This applies to both N4JS mode and JS strict mode.
In unrestricted JS the <literal>WithStatement</literal> is allowed but duplicates are not validated.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>In case of names introduced by <literal>ImportDeclaration</literal>s only <literal>NamedImportSpecifiers</literal>s are taken into account (their import name or its alias if available).
<literal>WildcardImportSpecifiers</literal>s are not taken into account.
Potential optimizations by compiler or user annotation are also not currently taken into account during analysis.</simpara>

<simpara>Rationale:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>We expect only few named nested functions.
Since this is expected to be a rare case, no shadowing should occur there as this is maybe not expected by the programmer.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>It is typical that nested environments define local variables.
In particular helper variables (such as <literal>i: number i</literal> or <literal>s: string</literal> ) are expected to be used quite often.
Since this is a typical case, we allow shadowing for local variables.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Function declarations may shadow type declarations.
However, both entities are to be handled completely differently, so that an error will occur if the shadowing is ignored by the programmer anyway.</simpara>

<simpara>Whether nominal or structural typing is used depends on the declaration of the type or the reference.

There is no inheritance supported for primitive types and built-in types – these types are final.</simpara>
<simpara>Although the diagram shows inheritance between <literal>void</literal> and <literal>undefined</literal>, this relationship is only semantic: <literal>void</literal> is a refinement of <literal>undefined</literal> from a type system viewpoint.

Aside from simple type references, type expressions may be used to specify the type of variables.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_syntax">
<title>Syntax</title>
<simpara>The listing <xref linkend="lst:EBNFTypeExpression"/> summarizes the type expression grammar.
Depending on the context, not all constructs are allowed.
For example, the variadic modifier is only allowed for function parameters.</simpara>
<simpara>References to user-declared types are expressed via <literal>ParameterizedTypeRef</literal>.
This is also true for non-generic types, as the type arguments are optional.
See <xref linkend="_parameterized-types"/> for details on that reference.</simpara>
<simpara>For qualified names and type reference names, see <xref linkend="_qualified-names"/></simpara>
<simpara>The type expressions are usually added to parameter, field, or variable declarations as a suffix, separated with colon (<literal>:</literal>).

<simpara>The ECMAScript types <emphasis>undefined</emphasis> and <emphasis>null</emphasis> are also supported.
These types cannot be referenced directly, however.
Note that <literal>void</literal> and <emphasis>undefined</emphasis> are almost similar.
Actually, the inferred type of a types element with declared type of <literal>void</literal> will be <emphasis>undefined</emphasis>.
The difference between void and undefined is that an element of type void can never have another type,
while an element of type undefined may be assigned a value later on and thus become a different type.
<literal>void</literal> is only used for function and method return types.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that not any type reference is allowed in any context.
Variables or formal parameters must not be declared <literal>void</literal> or union types must not be declared dynamic, for example.
These constraints are explained in the following section.</simpara>
<simpara>The types mentioned above are described in detail in the next sections.
They are hierarchically defined and the following list displays all possible types.
Note that all types are actually references to types.

<simpara>A type variable can be used in any type expression contained in the generic class, generic interface, or generic function / method definition.</simpara>
<example>

<simpara>Using a type variable in the upper bound reference may lead to recursive definition.</simpara>

}</programlisting>
</example>
<bridgehead xml:id="type-variables-type-inference" renderas="sect4">Type Inference</bridgehead>
<simpara>In many cases, type variables are not directly used in subtype relations as they are substituted with the concrete types specified by some type arguments.
In these cases, the ordinary subtype rules apply without change.
However, there are other cases in which type variables cannot be substituted:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>Inside a generic declaration.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If the generic type is used as raw type.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If a generic function / method is called without type arguments and without the possibility to infer the type from the context.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>In these cases, an unbound type variable may appear on one or both sides of a subtype relation and we require subtype rules that take type variables into account.</simpara>
<simpara>It is important to note that while type variables may have a declared upper bound, they cannot be simply replaced with that upper bound and treated like existential types.
The following example illustrates this:</simpara>
<example>
<title>Type variables vs. existential types</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {}
class B extends A {}
class C extends B {}

class G&lt;T&gt; {}

class X&lt;T extends A, S extends B&gt; {

    m(): void {

        // plain type variables:
        var t: T;
        var s: S;

        t = s;  // ERROR: "S is not a subtype of T." at "s" <co xml:id="CO1-1"/>

        // existential types:
        var ga: G&lt;? extends A&gt;;
        var gb: G&lt;? extends B&gt;;

        ga = gb;  <co xml:id="CO1-2"/>
    }
}</programlisting>
<calloutlist>
<callout arearefs="CO1-1">
<para>Even though the upper bound of <literal>S</literal> is a subtype of <literal>T</literal>’s upper bound (since <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>B</mi><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>&lt;</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>:</mtext></mstyle><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mi>A</mi></math>), we cannot infer that <literal>S</literal> is a subtype of <literal>T</literal>,
because there are valid concrete bindings for which this would not be true: for example, if <literal>T</literal> were bound to <literal>C</literal> and <literal>S</literal> to <literal>B</literal>.</para>
</callout>
<callout arearefs="CO1-2">

<simpara>We thus have to define subtype rules for type variables, taking the declared upper bound into account.

<simpara>If we have type variables on both sides: the result is true if and only if there is the identical type variable on both sides.</simpara>

<simpara>The main purpose of a parameterized type reference is to simply refer to the declared type.
If the declared type is a generic type, the parameterized type references defines a <emphasis>substitution</emphasis> of the type parameters of a generic type with actual type arguments.
A type argument can either be a concrete type, a wildcard or a type variable declared in the surrounding generic declaration.
The actual type arguments must conform to the type parameters so that code referencing the generic type parameters is still valid.</simpara>

<simpara>This concept of type erasure is purely defined for specification purposes.
It is not to be confused with the <literal>real</literal> type erasure which takes place at runtime, in which almost no types (except primitive types) are available.</simpara>
<simpara>That is, the type reference in <literal>var G&lt;string&gt; gs;</literal> actually defines a type <literal>G&lt;string&gt;</literal>, so that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mo>[</mo><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mrow><mo>[</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>G</mtext></mstyle><mo>&lt;</mo><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>string</mtext></mstyle><mo>&gt;</mo></math>.
It may reference a type defined by a class declaration <literal>class G&lt;T&gt;</literal>.
It is important that the type <literal>G&lt;string&gt;</literal> is different from <literal>G&lt;T&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If a parameterized type reference <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>R</mi></math> has no type arguments, then it is similar to the declared type.
That is, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mo>[</mo><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mrow><mo>[</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>R</mi><mrow><mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></math> if (and only if) <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>|</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>|</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math>.</simpara>
<simpara>In the following, we do not distinguish between parameter type reference and parameter type – they are both two sides of the same coin.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Raw Types</title>
<simpara>In Java, due to backward compatibility (generics were only introduced in Java 1.5), it is possible to use raw types in which we refer to a generic type without specifying any type arguments.
This is not possible in N4JS, as there is no unique interpretation of the type in that case as shown in the following example.
Given the following declarations:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A{}
class B extends A{}
class G&lt;T extends A&gt; { t: T; }
var g: G;</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>In this case, variable <literal>g</literal> refers to the <emphasis>raw type</emphasis> <literal>G</literal>.
This is forbidden in N4JS, because two interpretations are possible:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>g</literal> is of type <literal>G&lt;?  extends&gt;</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>g</literal> is of type <literal>G&lt;A&gt;</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>In the first case, an existential type would be created, and <literal>g.t = new A();</literal> must fail.</simpara>
<simpara>In the second case, <literal>g = new G&lt;B&gt;();</literal> must fail.</simpara>
<simpara>In Java, both assignments work with raw types, which is not really safe.
To avoid problems due to different interpretations, usage of raw types
is not allowed in N4JS. <footnote><simpara>Although raw type usage is prohibited, the N4JS validator interprets raw types according to the first case, which may lead to consequential errors.</simpara></footnote></simpara>
<simpara>Calls to generic functions and methods can also be parameterized, this is described in <xref linkend="_function-calls"/>.
Note that invocation of generic functions or methods does not need to be parameterized.</simpara>

<bridgehead xml:id="parameterized-types-type-inference" renderas="sect4">Type Inference</bridgehead>
<simpara>Type inference for parameterized types uses the concept of existential types (in Java, a slightly modified version called capture conversion is implemented).</simpara>
<simpara>The general concept for checking type conformance and inferring types for generic and parameterized types is described in [<link linkend="Igarashi01a">Igarashi01a</link>] for <emphasis>Featherweight Java with Generics</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>The concept of existential types with wildcard capture (a special kind of existential type) is published in [<link linkend="Torgersen05a">Torgersen05a</link>], further developed in [<link linkend="Cameron08b">Cameron08b</link>] (further developed in  [<link linkend="Cameron09a">Cameron09a</link>] [<link linkend="Summers10a">Summers10a</link>], also see [<link linkend="Wehr08a">Wehr08a</link>] for a similar approach).
The key feature of the Java generic wildcard handling is called capture conversion, described in [<link linkend="Gosling12a">Gosling12a(p.S5.1.10)</link>].
However, there are some slight differences to Java 6 and 7, only with Java 8 similar results can be expected.
All these papers include formal proofs of certain aspects, however even these paper lack proof of other aspect</simpara>
<simpara>The idea is quite simple: All unbound wildcards are replaced with freshly created new types <footnote><simpara>in the Java 8 spec and compiler, they are called type variables, which are types as well</simpara></footnote>,
fulfilling the constraints defined by the wildcard’s upper and lower bound.
These newly created types are then handled similar to real types during type inference and type conformance validation.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Existential Type</title>
<simpara>The inferred type of a variable
declared as</simpara>
<simpara><literal>var x: G&lt;? extends A&gt;;</literal>,</simpara>
<simpara>that is the parameterized type, is an existential type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>, which is a subtype of A.
If you have another variable declared as</simpara>
<simpara><literal>var y: G&lt;? extends A&gt;;</literal></simpara>
<simpara>another type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> is created, which is also a subtype of A.
Note that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>≠</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>! Assuming typical setter or getter in G, e.g. <literal>set(T t)</literal> and <literal>T get()</literal>, the following code snippet will produce an error:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>y.set(x.get())</literal></simpara>
<simpara>This is no surprise, as <literal>x.get()</literal> actually returns a type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>, which is not a subtype of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>.</simpara>
</example>
<simpara>The upper and lower bound declarations are, of course, still available during type inference for these existential types.
This enables the type inferencer to calculate the join and meet of parameterized types as well.</simpara>

upper bounds of of type arguments and the meet of the lower bounds of the type arguments.</simpara>
<simpara>For all type rules, we assume that the upper and lower bounds of a non-generic type, including type variables,
simply equal the type itself, that is for a given type <emphasis>T</emphasis>, the following constraints hold:<?asciidoc-br?>

</requirement>
<example>
<title>Upper and lower bound of parameterized types</title>
<simpara>Assuming the given classes listed above, the following upper and lower bounds are expected:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">G&lt;A&gt;            -&gt; upperBound = lowerBound = A
G&lt;? extends A&gt;  -&gt; lowerBound = null, upperBound = A
G&lt;? super A&gt;    -&gt; lowerBound = A, upperBound = any
G&lt;?&gt;            -&gt; lowerBound = null, upperBound = any</programlisting>
<simpara>This leads to the following expected subtype relations:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">(? extends A) &lt;: A  -&gt; true
(? super A) &lt;: A    -&gt; false
A &lt;: (? extends A)  -&gt; false
A &lt;: (? super A)    -&gt; true</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Note that there is a slight difference to Java: In N4JS it is not possible to use a generic type in a raw fashion, that is to say without specifying any type arguments.
In Java, this is possible due to backwards compatibility with early Java versions in which no generics were supported.</simpara>
<simpara>In case an upper bound of a type variable shall consist only of a few members, it seems convenient to use additional structural members,
like on interface I2 in the example <xref linkend="ex:use-declared-interfaces-for-lower-bounds"/> below.
However, type variables must not be constrained using structural types (see constraint <xref linkend="Req-IDE-76"/>).
Hence, the recommended solution is to use an explicitly declared interface that uses definition site structural typing for these constraints as an upper bound (see interface in <xref linkend="ex:use-declared-interfaces-for-lower-bounds"/>).</simpara>
<example xml:id="ex:use-declared-interfaces-for-lower-bounds">
<title>Use declared interfaces for lower bounds</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface I1&lt;T extends any with {prop : int}&gt; { // error
}

interface ~J {
    prop : int;
}
interface I2&lt;T extends J&gt; {
}</programlisting>

<simpara>N4JS provides the same basic types as ECMAScript [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.p.28)</link>].</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>In ECMAScript, basic types come in two flavors: as primitive types [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S8Types, p.p.28)</link>] and as Objects [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S15, p.p.102)</link>].
In N4JS, primitive types are written with lower cases, object types with first case capitalized.
For example, <literal>String</literal> is the primitive ECMAScript string type, while <literal>String</literal> is an object.</simpara>

<title>Primitive Pathselector and I18nKey</title>

These types are, in fact, translated to strings and do not add any new functionality.
They are solely defined for enabling additional validation.</simpara>

<simpara><literal>pathSelector&lt;T&gt;</literal> is a generic type for specifying path selector expressions. PathSelectors are used to specify a path to a property in a (JSON-like) model tree.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The type variable <literal>T</literal> defines the context type (or type of the root of the tree) in which the selector is to be validated.

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>i18nKey</literal> is a string which refers to an internationalization key.
The <literal>i18nKey</literal> type is used to reference resource keys specified in resource files.
In a project <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi></math>, the <literal>i18nKey</literal> type defines the transitive set of all resource keys accessible from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi></math>.
Since resource keys are specified as strings, this means that the <literal>i18nKey</literal> type defines a subset of all string literals that can be assigned to a variable of type <literal>i18nKey</literal> in the current project.
That means that an assignment of a string literal to a variable of type <literal>i18nKey</literal> is only valid if that string literal is contained in the set defined by <literal>i18nKey</literal>.
Resource keys are declared in the properties files of a project and all resource keys from a project are accessible to any project depending on it.</simpara>

<simpara>This example shows how union and intersection types affect the types of their field members in case the fields have different types.

<simpara>The simplification constraints are used by the type inferrer.
It may be useful, however, to define union types with superfluous elements, as the next example demonstrates</simpara>
<example>
<title>Superfluous elements in union type</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A{}
class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

function foo(p: union{A,B}) {..}</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Although <literal>B</literal> is superfluous, it may indicate that the function handles parameters of type differently than one of type <literal>A</literal> or <literal>C</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Although a union type is a <literal><link linkend="_acronyms">LCST</link></literal> of its contained (non-superfluous) types, the type inferrer usually does not create new union types when computing the join of types.
If the join of types including at least one union type is calculated, the union type is preserved if possible.
The same is true for meet.</simpara>
<simpara>For the definition of join and meet for union types, we define how a type is added to a union type:</simpara>

<simpara>In case the <literal>any</literal> type is used in a union type, all other types in the union type definition become obsolete.
However, defining other typers along with the <literal>any</literal> type might seem reasonable in case those other types are treated specifically and thus are mentioned explicitly in the definition.
Nevertheless the use of the <literal>any</literal> type produces a warning, since its use can indicate a misunderstanding of the union type concept and since documentation can also be done in a comment.</simpara>

<title>Intersection Type</title>
<simpara>Intersection type reflects the dynamic nature of JavaScript, similar to union type.
As in Java, intersection type is used to define the type boundaries of type variables in type parameter definitions.
They are inferred by the type inferencer for type checking (as a result of join or meet).
In contrast to Java, however, intersection type can be declared explicitly by means of intersection type expression.<footnote><simpara>For type theory about intersection types, see [<link linkend="Pierce02a">Pierce02a(p.15.7)</link>] and [<link linkend="Laurent12a">Laurent12a</link>], other languages supporting explicit notion of intersection type include Ceylon [<link linkend="King13a">King13a(p.3.2.4/5)</link>].</simpara></footnote></simpara>

<simpara>An intersection type may contain several interfaces but only one class.
It virtually declares a subclass of this one class and implements all interfaces declared in the intersection type.
If no class is declared in the intersection type, the intersection type virtually declares a subclass of an N4Object instead.
This virtual subclass also explains why only one single class may be contained in the intersection.</simpara>

<title>Warnings</title>
<simpara>Using <literal>any</literal> types in intersection types is obsolete since they do not change the resulting intersection type.
E.g. the intersection type of A, B and <literal>any</literal> is equivialent to the intersection type of A and B.
However, using the <literal>any</literal> type is no error because it can be seen as a neutral argument to the intersection.
Nevertheless the use of the <literal>any</literal> type produces a warning, since its use can indicate a misunderstanding of the intersection type concept and since it always can be omitted.</simpara>

<simpara>The use of the <literal>any</literal> type in an intersection type is similar to the following case.
When two types are used, one of them a supertype of the other, then this supertype is obsolete.
Hence, a warning will be produced to indicate unecessary code.
The warning is only produced when both of the types are either classes or interfaces, since e.g. structural types are supertypes of any classes or interfaces.</simpara>

<simpara>The following table shows how non-method members of union types are merged.
The resulting member type depends on whether the member is being accessed during a read (R) or write (W) operation.
The type of a field, of a getter or of the parameter of a setter is indicated in brackets.</simpara>

In other words, a property 'p' in the union type is the greates common denominator of all 'p' in T_{1} and T_{2}.
It is not quite that simple, however, as the question of "equality” with regards to properties has to be answered.</simpara>

<title>Constructor and Classifier Type</title>
<simpara>A class definition as described in <xref linkend="_classes"/> declares types.
Often, it is necessary to access these types directly, for example to access staticmembers or for dynamic construction of instances.
These two use cases are actually slightly different and N4JS provides two different types, one for each use case: constructor and classifier type.<footnote><simpara>The classifier type is, in fact, the <literal>type type</literal> or <literal>metatype</literal> of a type. We use the term classifier type in the specification to avoid the bogus <literal>type type</literal> terminology.</simpara></footnote>
The constructor is basically the classifier type with the additional possibility to call it via <literal>new</literal> in order to create new instances of the declared type.</simpara>
<simpara>Both <literal>meta</literal> types are different from Java’s type <literal>Class&lt;T&gt;</literal>, as the latter has a defined set of members, while the N4JS metatypes will have members according to a class definition.
The concept of constructors as metatypes is similar to ECMAScript 2015 [<link linkend="ECMA15a">ECMA15a(p.14.5)</link>].</simpara>

<simpara>If the type argument of the constructor is not a declared type (i.e., a wildcard or a type variable with bounds), the constructor cannot be used in a new expression.

<simpara>Note that this is only true for the right hand side of the subtyping rule.
A constructor type with a wildcard is never a subtype of a constructor type without a wildcard.</simpara>

<simpara>Consequences:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Overriding of static methods is possible and by using the constructor or classifier type, polymorphism for static methods is possible as well.</simpara>
<example xml:id="_polymorphism-and-static-methods">
<title>Static Polymorphism</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {
    static foo(): string { return "A"; }
    static bar(): string { return this.foo(); }
}
class B extends A {
    @Override
    static foo(): string { return "B"; }
}

A.bar(); // will return "A"
B.bar(); // will return "B", as foo() is called polymorphical</programlisting>
</example>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>It is even possible to refer to the constructor of an abstract class.
The abstract class itself cannot provide this constructor (it only provides a type..), that is to say only concrete subclasses can provide constructors compatible to the constructor.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Constructor of Abstract Class</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">abstract class A {}
class B extends A {}
function f(ctor: constructor{A}): A { return new ctor(); }

f(A); // not working: type{A} is not a subtype of constructor{A}.
f(B); // ok</programlisting>
</example>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Allowing wildcards on constructor type references has pragmatic reasons.
The usage of constructor references usually indicates very dynamic scenarios.
In some of these scenarios, e.g., in case of dynamic creation of objects in the context of generic testing or injectors, arbitrary constructors may be used.
Of course, it won’t be possible to check the correct new expression call in these cases – and using new expressions is prevented by N4JS if the constructor reference contains a wildcard.
But other constraints, implemented by the client logic, may guarantee correct instantiation via more dynamic constructors, for example via the ECMAScript 2015 reflection API.
In order to simplify these scenarios and preventing the use of <literal>any</literal>, wildcards are supported in constructors. Since a constructor with a wildcard cannot be used
in a new expression anyway, using a classifier type is usually better than using a constructor type with wildcard.</simpara>
<simpara>Using wildcards on classifier types would have the same meaning as using the upper bound directly.
That is, a type reference <literal>type{? extends C}</literal> can simply be replaced with <literal>type{c}</literal>, and <literal>type{?}</literal> with <literal>type{any}</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To conclude this chapter, let us compare the different types introduced above depending on whether they are used with wildcards or not:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>having a value of type <literal>constructor{C}</literal>, we know we have</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>a constructor function of <literal>{C}</literal> or a subclass of <literal>{C}</literal>,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>that can be used for instantiation (i.e. the represented class is not abstract),</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>that has a signature compatible to the owned or inherited constructor of <literal>{C}</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>This means we have the constructor function of class <literal>{C}</literal> (but only if is non-abstract) or the constructor function of any non-abstract
subclass of <literal>{C}</literal> with an override compatible signature to that of <literal>{C}</literal>'s constructor function.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>having a value of type <literal>constructor{? extends C}</literal>, we know we have</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>a constructor function of <literal>{C}</literal> or a subclass of <literal>{C}</literal>,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>that can be used for instantiation (i.e. the represented class is not abstract).</simpara>
<simpara>So, same situation as before except that we know nothing about the constructor function’s signature.
However, if <literal>{C}</literal> has a covariant constructor, cf. <xref linkend="_covariant-constructors"/>, we can still conclude that we have an override compatible
constructor function to that of <literal>{C}</literal>, because classes with covariant constructors enforce all their subclasses to have override compatible constructors.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>have a value of type <literal>type{? extends C}</literal> or <literal>type{C}</literal> (the two types are equivalent), we know we have:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>an object representing a type (often constructor functions are used for this, e.g. in the case of classes, but could also be a plain object, e.g. in the case of interfaces),</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>that represents type <literal>{C}</literal> or a subtype thereof,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>that cannot be used for instantiation (e.g. could be the constructor function of an abstract class, the object representing an interface, etc.).</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Slightly simplified, we can say that in the first above case we can always use the value for creating an instance with <literal>new</literal>, in the second case only if the
referenced type has a covariant constructor, cf. <xref linkend="_covariant-constructors"/>, and never in the third case.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara><xref linkend="fig-constructors-and-prototypes"/> shows plain ECMAScript 2015 only.
Also note that <literal>A</literal> is defined without an <literal>extends</literal> clause, which is what ECMAScript 2015 calls a <emphasis>base class</emphasis> (as opposed to a <emphasis>derived class</emphasis>).
The constructor of a base class always has Function.prototype as its prototype.
If we had defined <literal>A</literal> as <literal>class A extends Object {}</literal> in the listing above, then the constructor of <literal>A</literal> would have Object’s constructor as its prototype
(depicted in as a dashed red arrow), which would make a more consistent overall picture.</simpara>

<simpara>Base classes in the above sense are not available in N4JS.
If an N4JS class does not provide an <literal>extends</literal> clause, it will implicitly inherit from built-in class <literal>N4Object</literal>,

<simpara>Remarks</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>Due to the function subtype relation and constraints on overriding methods (in which the overriding method has to be a subtype of the overridden method),
it is not possible to use the <literal>this</literal> type in formal parameters but only as return type. The following listing demonstrates that problem:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {
    bar(x: this): void { ... } // error
    // virtually defines: bar(x: A): void
}
class B extends A {
    // virtually defines: bar(x: B): void
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> type is replaced similar to a type variable, the virtually defined method <literal>bar</literal> in is not override compatible with <literal>bar</literal> in <literal>A</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In case of constructors, this problem does not occur because a subclass constructor does not need to be override compatible with the constructor of the super class.
Using <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> as the type of a constructor’s parameter, however, would mean that you can only create an instance of the class if you already have
an instance (considering that due to the lack of method overloading a class can have only a single constructor), making creation of the first instance impossible.
Therefore, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> is also disallowed as the type of a constructor’s parameter.</simpara>

<simpara>The difference between the type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> and the keyword <literal>this</literal> is when and how theactual type is set:
the actual type of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> type is computed at compile(or validation) time and is always the containing type (of the member in which the type expression is used)
or a subtype of that type – this isnot a heuristic, this is so by definition.
In contrast, the actual typeof the keyword <literal>this</literal> is only available at runtime, while the type used at compilation time is only a heuristically-computed type, in other words,a good guess.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>The value of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> type is, in fact, not influenced by any <literal>@This</literal> annotations.
Instead of using <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> in these cases, the type expressions in the <literal>@This</literal> annotations can be used.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>The <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi></math> type is always bound to the instance-type regardless of the context it occurs in (non-static or static).
To refer to the this-classifier (static type) the construct <literal>type{this}</literal> is used.</simpara>

<title>Enums</title>
<simpara>Enums are an ordered set of literals.
Although enums are not true classes, they come with built-in methods for accessing value, name and type name of the enum.</simpara>
<simpara>In N4JS, two flavours of enumerations are distinguished: ordinary enums (N4JS) and string based enums.
Ordinary enums (or in short, enums) are used while programming in N4JS.
String based enums are introduced to access enumerations derived from standards, mainly developed by the W3C, in order to access the closed set of string literals defined in webIDL syntax.</simpara>

<title>String-Based Enums</title>
<simpara>In current web standards [<link linkend="W3C:Steen:14:XL">W3C:Steen:14:XL</link>], definitions of enumerations are often given in webIDL syntax.
While the webIDL-definition assembles a set of unique string literals as a named enum-entity, the language binding to ECMAScript refers to the usage of the members of these enumerations only.
Hence, if an element of an enumeration is stored in a variable or field, passed as a parameter into a method or function or given back as a result, the actual type in JavaScript will be <literal>string</literal>.
To provide the N4JS user with some validations regarding the validity of a statement at compile time, a special kind of subtypes of <literal>string</literal> are introduced: the string-based enum using the <literal>@StringBased</literal> annotation.
(See also other string-based types like <literal>typename&lt;T&gt;</literal> <literal>pathSelector&lt;T&gt;</literal> and <literal>i18nKey</literal> in <xref linkend="_primitive-pathselector-and-i18nkey"/>.)</simpara>
<simpara>String-based enums do not have any kind of runtime representation; instead, the transpiler will replace each reference to a literal of a string-based enum by a corresponding string literal in the output code.
Furthermore, no meta-information is available for string-based enums, i.e. the <literal>n4type</literal> property is not available.
The only exception is the static getter <literal>literals</literal>: it is available also for string-based enums and has the same meaning.
In case of string-based enums, however, there won’t be a getter used at runtime; instead, the transpiler replaces every read access to this getter by an array literal containing a string literal for each of the enum’s literals.</simpara>

<title>Definition of Classes</title>
<simpara>Classes are either declared with a class declaration on top level, or they can be used as anonymous classes in expressions.
The latter may have a name, which may be used for error messages and reflection.</simpara>
<simpara>At the current stage, class expressions are effectively disabled at least until the semantics of them are finalized in ECMAScript 6.</simpara>
<simpara>In N4JS (as in many other languages) multi-inheritance of classes is not supported.
Although the <literal>diamond problem</literal> (of functions being defined in both superclasses) could be solved via union and intersection types, this would lead to problems when calling these super implementations.
This is particularly an issue due to JavaScript not supporting
multiple prototypes.<footnote><simpara>E.g., for given <literal role="language-n4js">class A{ foo(A):A{}} class B{ foo(B):B{}}</literal>, a class C could be defined as <literal role="language-n4js">class C{ foo(union{A,B}):intersection{A,B}{}}</literal>. In this case it would then be a syntactical problem (and even worse - a conceptual problem) of how to call the super methods defined in A and Bfrom C.</simpara></footnote>
Interfaces, however, allow for multi-inheritance. Since the former can also define functions with bodies, this is not a hard restriction.</simpara>

<simpara>Mixing in members (i.e. interface’s methods with default implementation or fields) is similar to mixing in members from roles as defined in [<link linkend="Dart13a">Dart13a(p.S9.1)</link>].
It is also similar to default implementations in Java 8 [<link linkend="Gosling15a">Gosling15a</link>].
In Java, however, more constraints exist, (for example, methods of interfaces must be public).</simpara>

<simpara>Extensibility refers to whether a given classifier can be subtyped.
Accessibility is a prerequisite for extensibility.
If a type cannot be seen, it cannot be subclassed.
The only modifier influencing the extensibility directly is the annotation <literal>@Final</literal>, which prevents all subtyping.

<title>Semantics</title>
<simpara>Interfaces are used to describe the public <link linkend="_acronyms">API</link> of a classifier.
The main requirement is that the instance of an interface, which must be an instance of a class since interfaces cannot have instances, provides all members declared in the interface.
Thus, a (concrete) class implementing an interface must provide implementations for all the fields, methods, getters and setters of the interface (otherwise it the class must be declared abstract).
The implementations have to be provided either directly in the class itself, through a superclass, or by the interface if the member has a default implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>A field declaration in an interface denotes that all implementing classes can either provide a field of the same name and the same(!) type or corresponding field accessors.
If no such members are defined in the class or a (transitive) superclass, the field is mixed in from the interface automatically.
This is also true for the initializer of the field.</simpara>
<simpara>All instance methods, getters and setters declared in an interface are implicitly abstract if they do not provide a default implementation.
The modifier <literal>abstract</literal> is not required, therefore, in the source code.
The following constraints apply:</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>not allowing field accessors to be declared final was a deliberate decision, because it would complicate the internal handling of member redefinition; might be reconsidered at a later time</simpara>
</note>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The literal may not be used in the initializer expression of a field of an interface.<?asciidoc-br?>
This restriction is required, because the order of implementation of these fields in an implementing class cannot be guaranteed.
This applies to both instance and static fields in interfaces, but in case of static fields, <literal>this</literal> is also disallowed due to <xref linkend="_static-members-of-interfaces"/>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</requirement>
<simpara>It is possible to declare members in interfaces with a smaller visibility as the interface itself.
In that case, clients of the interface may be able to use the interface but not to implement it.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to simplify modeling of runtime types, such as elements, interfaces do not only support the notation of static methods but constant data fields as well.
Since <link linkend="_acronyms">IDL</link> [<link linkend="OMG14a">OMG14a</link>] is used to describe these elements in specifications (and mapped to JavaScript via rules described in [<link linkend="W3C12a">W3C12a</link>])
constant data fields are an often-used technique there and they can be modeled in N4JS 1:1.</simpara>
<simpara>As specified in <xref linkend="Req-IDE-56"/>, interfaces cannot contain a constructor i.e.<?asciidoc-br?>

<simpara>If a classifier <literal>C</literal> <emphasis>implements</emphasis> an interface <literal>I</literal>, we say <literal>I</literal> is <emphasis>implemented</emphasis> by <literal>C</literal>.
If <literal>C</literal> redefines members declared in <literal>I</literal>, we say that these members are <emphasis>implemented</emphasis> by <literal>C</literal>.

<simpara>

A generic classifier is a classifier with at least one type parameter.
That is, a given classifier <literal>C</literal> is generic if and only if <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>|</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>|</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>1</mn></math>.</simpara>
<simpara>If a classifier does not define any type parameters, it is not generic, even if its superclass or any implemented interface is generic.</simpara>
<simpara>The format of the type parameter expression is described in <xref linkend="_parameterized-types"/>.
The type variable defined by the type parameter’s type expression can be used just like a normal type inside the class definition.</simpara>
<simpara>If using a generic classifier as type of a variable, it may be parameterized.
This is usually done via a type expression (cf. <xref linkend="_parameterized-types"/>) or via <literal>typearg</literal> in case of supertypes.
If a generic classifier defines multiple type variables, these variables are bound in the order of their definition.
In any case, all type variables have to be bound.
That means in particular that raw types are not allowed. (cf <xref linkend="_parameterized-types"/> for details).</simpara>
<simpara>If a generic classifier is used as super classifier, the type arguments can be type variables.
Note that the type variable of the super classifier is not lifted, that is to say that all type variables are to be explicitly bound in the type references used in the <literal>extend</literal>, <literal>with</literal>, or <literal>implements</literal> section using <literal>typearg</literal>.
If a type variable is used in <literal>typearg</literal> to bound a type variable of a type parameter, it has to fulfil possible type constraints (upper/lower bound) specified in the type parameter.</simpara>

<example xml:id="ex:use-site-declaration-variance">
<title>Use-site declaration of variance</title>
<simpara>For illustration purposes, let’s compare use-site and definition-site declaration of variance.
Since use-site variance is more familiar to the Java developer, we start with this flavor.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Person {
    name: string;
}
class Employee extends Person {}

interface List&lt;T&gt; {
    add(elem: T)
    read(idx: int): T
}

function getNameOfFirstPerson(list: List&lt;? extends Person&gt;): string {
    return list.read(0).name;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Function <literal>getNameOfFirstPerson</literal> below takes a list and returns the name of the first person in the list.
Since it never adds new elements to the given list, it could accept <literal>List</literal>s of any subtype of <literal>Person</literal>, for example a <literal>List&lt;Employee&gt;</literal>.
To allow this, its formal parameter has a type of <literal>List&lt;? extends Person&gt;</literal> instead of <literal>List&lt;Person&gt;</literal>.
Such use-site variance is useful whenever an invariant type, like <literal>List</literal> above, is being used in a way such that it can be treated as if it were co- or contravariant.</simpara>
<simpara>Sometimes, however, we are dealing with types that are inherently covariant or contravariant, for example an <literal>ImmutableList</literal> from which we can only read elements would be covariant.
In such a case, use-site declaration of variance is tedious and error-prone: we would have to declare the variance wherever the type is being used and would have to
make sure not to forget the declaration or otherwise limit the flexibility and reusability of the code (for example, in the above code we could not call <literal>getNameOfFirstPerson</literal> with a <literal>List&lt;Employee&gt;</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>The solution is to declare the variance on declaration site, as in the following code sample:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface ImmutableList&lt;out T&gt; {
//  add(elem: T)  // error: such a method would now be disallowed
    read(idx: int): T
}

function getNameOfFirstPerson2(list: ImmutableList&lt;Person&gt;): string {
    return list.read(0).name;
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Now we can invoke <literal>getNameOfFirstPerson2</literal> with a <literal>List&lt;Employee&gt;</literal> even though the implementor of <literal>getNameOfFirstPerson2</literal> did not add a
use-site declaration of covariance, because the type <literal>ImmutableList</literal> is declared to be covariant with respect to its parameter <literal>T</literal>, and this applies globally
throughout the program.</simpara>

<emphasis role="strong">Requirement: IDE-54:</emphasis>
<link linkend="Req-IDE-54">Method Assignment</link> (ver. 1)</simpara>
    <simpara>

. In contrast to ECMAScript 2015, methods are defined as readonly, that is, it is not possible to dynamically re-assign a property defined as method with a new value.
This is because assigning or re-assigning a method breaks encapsulation. Methods are the <xref linkend="_acronyms"/> of a class, their implementation is internal to the class.
.  When assigning a method to a variable, a warning is issued since this would lead to an detached this reference inside the method when it is called without explicitly providing the receiver. No warning is issued only if it is guaranteed that no problems will occur:
..  The method’s body can be determined at compile time (i.e., it has been declared <literal>@Final</literal>) and it lacks usages of <literal>this</literal> or <literal>super</literal>. This is true for instance and static methods.
..  The method is the constructor.</simpara>
</requirement>
<note>
<simpara>The following code demonstrates problems arising when methods are assigned to variables in terms of function expressions.
Given are two classes and instances of each class as follows:</simpara>
</note>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {
    m(): void { }
    static k(): void {}
}
class D extends C {
    @Override m(): void { this.f()}
    f(): void {}

    @Override static k(): void { this.f()}
    static f(): void {}
}
var c: C = new C();
var d: C = new D(); // d looks like a C</programlisting>
<simpara>Assigning an instance method to a variable could cause problems, as the method assumes this to be bound to the class in which it is defined.
This may work in some cases, but will cause problems in particular in combination with method overriding:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var v1: {@This(C)function():void} = c.m;
var v2: {@This(C)function():void} = d.m;

v1.call(c);
v2.call(c);</programlisting>
<simpara>Calling <literal>c.m</literal> indirectly via <literal>v1</literal> with <literal>c</literal> as this object will work.
However, it won’t work for <literal>v2</literal>: the method is overridden in <literal>D</literal>, and the method in expects other methods available in <literal>D</literal> but not in <literal>C</literal>.
That is, the last call would lead to a runtime error as method <literal>f</literal> which is called in <literal>D.m</literal> won’t be available.</simpara>
<simpara>The same scenario occurs in case of static methods if they are retrieved polymorphically via the variables of type <literal>constructor{C}</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var ctor: constructor{C} = C;
var dtor: constructor{C} = D;

var v3: {@This(constructor{C})function():void} = ctor.k;
var v4: {@This(constructor{C})function():void} = dtor.k;</programlisting>
<simpara>In both cases, the problem could be solved by restricting these kinds of assignments to final methods only.
In the static case, the problem would also be solved by accessing the static method directly via the class type (and not polymorphically via the constructor).
Both restrictions are severe but would be necessary to avoid unexpected runtime problems.</simpara>
<simpara>The following example shows a problem with breaking the encapsulation of a class.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {
    x: any = "";
    f(): void { this.g(this); }
    g(c: C): void { c.h(); }
    h(): void {}
}
class D extends C {

    @Override f(): void {
        this.g(this.x);
    }
    @Override g(c: any) {
        // do nothing, do not call h())
    }
}

var c = new C();
var d = new D();

var v5: {@This(C)function():void} = c.f;
var v6: {@This(C)function():void} = d.f;

v5.call(c)
v6.call(c)</programlisting>
<simpara>In <literal>D</literal>, method <literal>g</literal> is overridden to accept more types as the original method defined in <literal>C</literal>.
Calling this new method with receiver type <literal>C</literal> (as done in the last line) will cause problems, as in <literal>D</literal> not only <literal>f</literal> has been adapted but also <literal>g</literal>.
Eventually, this would lead to a runtime error as well.</simpara>

<title>Final Methods</title>
<simpara>By default, methods can be overridden.
To prevent a method from being overridden, it must be annotated with <literal>@Final</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Of course, a method cannot be declared both abstract and final (cf. <xref linkend="Req-IDE-46"/>).

<title>Final Methods in Interfaces</title>

<title>Structural This Type in Constructor</title>
<simpara>The use of a structural this reference as a formal parameter type is possible only in constructors.
This parameter can be annotated with <literal>@Spec</literal> which causes the compiler to generate initialization code.</simpara>
<simpara>Simply using <literal>this</literal> as a type in the constructor causes the constructor to require an object providing all public fields of the class for initialization purposes.
The fields have to be set manually as shown in the following code snippet.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A{
    public s: string;

<simpara>Remarks:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The type of the formal parameter <literal>~~this</literal> refers to the structural field type, see <xref linkend="_structural-typing"/> for details on structural typing.
It contains all public fields of the type.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Subclasses may override the constructor and introduce additional parameters.
They have to call the super constructor explicitly, however, providing a parameter with at least all required attributes of the superclass.
Usually the type <literal>this</literal> is replaced with the actual subclass, but in the case of a <literal>super()</literal> call the <literal>this</literal> type of structural formal parameters is replaced with the <literal>this</literal> type of the superclass,
hence only required fields of the superclass must be present.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>As with other structural references, it is possible to add the structural reference with additional structural members, which can be used to initialize private fields which
become not automatically part of the structural field type. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A{
    public s: string;
    private myPrivateNumber: number;
    public constructor(src: ~~this with { x: number; }) {
        this.s = src.s;
        this.myPrivateNumber = src.x;
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Defining additional members may become a problem if a subclass defines  public fields with the same name, as the <literal>~~this</literal> type will contain these fields in the subclass.

<simpara>The rationale for this different handling of fields from super classes and implemented interfaces is
1. fields from an implemented interface are not seen as inherited but rather implemented by implementing class, so from
   the <literal>@Spec</literal> annotation&#8217;s perspective the field is a field of the implementing class, and
2. in case of a field inherited from a super class the correct way of initialization may depend on details of the super
   class and has to be taken care of by custom code in the constructor of the subclass (usually by invoking the non-<literal>@Spec</literal>
   constructor of the superclass with <literal>super</literal>).</simpara>

<simpara>The following examples illustrate further details of other use cases of spec constructors.</simpara>

<title>Anonymous Interface in Constructor</title>
<simpara>The base class <literal>A</literal> in the examples redefines the constructor already defined in <literal>N4Object</literal>. This is not

<simpara>The last case (class E) demonstrates a special feature of the typing strategy modifier in combination with the <literal>this</literal> type, see <xref linkend="_structural-typing"/> for details.</simpara>
<simpara>The constructor in class <literal>B</literal> contains an error because the super constructor expects all required attributes in <literal>A1</literal> to be set.

<simpara>Usually, the constructor of a subclass need not be override compatible with the constructor of its super class.
By way of annotation <literal>@CovariantConstructor</literal> it is possible to change this default behavior and enforce all subclasses to have constructors with override compatible signatures.
A subclass can achieve this by either inheriting the constructor from the super class (which is usually override compatible,
with the special case of <literal>@Spec</literal> constructors) or by defining a new constructor with a signature compatible to the inherited constructor.
The same rules as for method overriding apply.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>@CovariantConstructor</literal> annotation may be applied to the constructor, the containing classifier, or both.

<simpara>The following example demonstrates a use case for covariant constructors.
It shows a small class hierarchy using covariant constructors, <literal>Cls</literal> and <literal>Cls2</literal>, together with a helper function <literal>createAnother</literal> that creates and returns a new instance of the same type as its argument <literal>value</literal>.</simpara>
<example xml:id="ex:covariant_constructors">
<title>Covariant Constructors</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {}
class B extends A {}

@CovariantConstructor
class Cls {
    constructor(p: B) {}
}
class Cls2 extends Cls {
    constructor(p: A) { // it's legal to generalize the type of parameter 'p'
        super(null);
    }
}

function &lt;T extends Cls&gt; createAnother(value: T, p: B): T {
    let ctor = value.constructor;
    return new ctor(p);
}

let x = new Cls2(new A());
let y: Cls2;

y = createAnother(x, new B());</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>In the code of <xref linkend="ex:covariant_constructors"/>, we would get an error if we changed the type of parameter <literal>p</literal> in the constructor of <literal>Cls2</literal> to some other type that
is not a super type of <literal>B</literal>, i.e. the type of the corresponding parameter of <literal>Cls</literal>’s constructor.
If we removed the <literal>@CovariantConstructor</literal> annotation on <literal>Cls</literal>, we would get an error in the new expression inside function <literal>createAnother</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The next example illustrates how to use <literal>@CovariantConstructor</literal> with interfaces and shows a behavior that might be surprising at first sight.</simpara>
<example xml:id="ex:covariant-constructors-in-interfaces">
<title>Covariant Constructors in Interfaces</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">@CovariantConstructor
interface I {
    constructor(p: number)
}

class C implements I {
    // no constructor required!
}

class D extends C {
    // XPECT errors --&gt; "Signature of constructor of class D does not conform to overridden constructor of class N4Object: {function(number)} is not a subtype of {function()}." at "constructor"
    constructor(p: number) {}
}</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Interface <literal>I</literal> declares a covariant constructor expecting a single parameter of type <literal>number</literal>.
Even though class <literal>C</literal> implements <literal>I</literal>, it does not need to define an owned constructor with such a parameter.
According to <xref linkend="Req-IDE-60"/>, it is enough for <literal>C</literal> to have a constructor, either owned or inherited, that is override compatible with the one declared by <literal>I</literal>.
Class <literal>C</literal> inherits the default constructor from <literal>N4Object</literal>, which does not have any arguments and is thus override compatible to <literal>I</literal>’s constructor.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition, subclasses are now required to have constructors which are override compatible with the constructor of class <literal>C</literal>, i.e. the one inherited from <literal>N4Object</literal>.
<xref linkend="ex:covariant-constructors-in-interfaces"/> shows that this is violated even when repeating the exact same constructor signature from interface <literal>I</literal>,
because that constructor now appears on the other side of the subtype test during checking override compatibility.</simpara>

<title>Data Fields</title>
<simpara>A data field is a simple property of a class.
There must be no getter or setter defined with the same name as the data field.
In ECMAScript 6, a class has no explicit data fields.
It is possible, however, to implicitly define a data field by simply assigning a value to a variable of the this element (e.g. <literal>this.x = 10</literal> implicitly defines a field <literal>x</literal>).
Data fields in N4JS are similar to these implicit fields in ECMAScript 6 except that they are defined explicitly in order to simplify validation and user assistance.</simpara>

<simpara>Notes with regard to syntax: Although ECMAScript 6 does not define fields in classes, it defines getter and setter methods similarly (cf. [<link linkend="ECMA15a">ECMA15a(p.S13.3, p.p.209)</link>]).</simpara>
<example>
<title>Getter and Setter</title>
<simpara>The getter and setter implementations usually reference data fields internally.
These are to be declared explicitly (although ECMAScript allows creating fields on the fly on their first usage).
The following example demonstrates a typical usage of getter and setter in combination with a data field.
The getter lazily initializes the field on demand.
The setter performs some notification.</simpara>

<simpara>Moreover, optionality has an effect in case of ternary expression <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>L</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>:</mi><mi>R</mi></math> in which the left-hand side is a ternary expression, e.g. <literal>l = b? trueExpr : falseExpr</literal> whose <literal>trueExpr</literal> or <literal>falseExpr</literal> possibly recursively contains an expression of the kind mentioned above. In this case, the optionality effect is the more restricted optinality of <literal>trueExpr</literal> and <literal>falseExpr</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>If, according to these rules, a data field / getter / setter of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>R</mi></math> need not be present in
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>L</mi></math> but a member with the same name and access is actually present in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>L</mi></math>, that member in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>L</mi></math>
must be a data field / getter / setter of the same type / a subtype / a super type, respectively.
In other words, if a not actually required member is present in the subtype, ordinary rules
for member compatibility apply as if no optionality were involved (cf. general subtyping rules
for structural types).</simpara>
</requirement>
<simpara>In other words, in object literals (cases 1 and 4a) neither optional getters, optional setters,
nor optional data fields are required. However, in case of new expressions and instances of
final classes (cases 2, 3, 4b, 4c) only optional getters are not required in a subtype;
optional setters are required as normal (i.e. optionality ignored) and optional data fields
require at least a setter.</simpara>
<simpara>The following table summarizes the most common cases and shows how this relates to the different
forms of structural typing.</simpara>

<simpara>The following example illustrates why optionality of fields has to be restricted
to the few special cases defined above (i.e. object literals, new expressions, etc.).</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Problem 1 of optional fields</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {

class D {}
class DD extends D {
	public field: number = 42;
}

let c: ~C;
let d: D;

d = new DD();

c = d;  // without the restrictive semantics of optional fields, this assignment would be allowed (but shows compile-time error in N4JS)

console.log(c.field); // prints 42 even though the type is string
c.field.charAt(0); // exception at runtime: c.field.charAt is not a function</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the last line of the above example, <literal>c.field</literal> is actually <literal>42</literal> but the type systems claims it is of type <literal>string</literal> and
thus allows accessing member <literal>charAt</literal> of type <literal>string</literal> which is undefined at runtime the actual value <literal>42</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The next example shows why cases 2 and 3 (i.e. new expressions and instances of final classes) have to be handled in
a more restrictive manner than case 1 (i.e. object literals).</simpara>

c.field = "hello";</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>In the previous code, if <literal>c = new D()</literal> were allowed, we would add a new property <literal>field</literal> to the instance of class

<title>Static Members</title>
<simpara>Static data fields, field accessors and methods are quite similar to instance members, however they are not members of instances of the type but the type itself.
They are defined similarly to instance members except that they are specified with the modifier <literal>static</literal>.
Since they are members of the type, the <literal>this</literal> keyword is not bound to instances of the class, but again to the type itself.
This is similar as in ECMAScript 6 ([<link linkend="ECMA15a">ECMA15a(p.14.5.15)</link>]).
Since static members are not instance but type members, it is even possible that a static member has the same name as an instance member.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that static members are not only allowed in classes but also in interfaces, but there are important differences
(for example, no inheritance of static members of interfaces, cf. Section <xref linkend="_static-members-of-interfaces"/>).</simpara>

<simpara>In the special case of <literal>m</literal> being a static data field, write-access is only possible via the defining type name <literal>C.m</literal>.
In the list above, only the first line can be used when assigning values to a field. Note that this only applies to fields and set-accessors.<footnote><simpara>The technical reason for this rule is the way properties are stored in JavaScript. Take for an example subclass-write access : <literal role="language-n4js">class C { static f="a";}</literal> with <literal role="language-n4js">class D extends C { }</literal>. Now the data field <literal>f</literal> on <literal>C</literal> can also be queried using <literal>D</literal> (<literal role="language-n4js">var q=D.f;</literal>) but writing (<literal role="language-n4js">D.f="b";</literal>) would introduce a newly created property <literal>f</literal> on class <literal>D</literal>, which differs from the one defined on <literal>C</literal>. It would do this without explicitly overriding the inherited property. Subsequent reads to <literal role="language-n4js">D.f</literal> would route to this ’accidentally’ introduced property. Such a behavior would not be expected and therefore has been disallowed. Note that this write restriction applies to data-fields and to field setters.</simpara></footnote></simpara>
<simpara>It is even possible to call a static field accessor or method of a class using dynamic polymorphism, as demonstrated in the following example:</simpara>
<example xml:id="ex:Polymorphism_and_static_methods">
<title>Static members of classes, inheritance and polymorphism</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {
    static m(): void { console.log('A#m'); }

    static foo(): void { console.log('A#foo'); }

    static bar(): void {
        this.foo();
    }
}

class B extends A {
    @Override
    static foo(): void { console.log('B#foo'); }
}

A.m(); // will print "A#m"
B.m(); // will print "A#m" (m is inherited by B)

var t: type{A} = A;
t.foo(); // will print "A#foo"
t = B;
t.foo(); // will print "B#foo"

// using 'this':

A.bar(); // will print "A#foo"
B.bar(); // will print "B#foo"</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>This is quite different from Java where static methods are not inherited and references to static methods are statically bound at compile time
depending on the declared type of the receiver (and not its value):</simpara>
<example>
<title>Static members in Java</title>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// !!! JAVA CODE !!!
public class C {

    static void m() { System.out.println("C#m"); }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final C c = null;
        c.m();  // will print "C#m" (no NullPointerException at runtime)
    }
}</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_generic-static-methods">
<title>Generic static methods</title>
<simpara>It is not possible to refer to type variables of a generic class, as these type variables are never bound to any concrete types.
A static method can, however, be declared generic.
Generic static methods are defined similarly to generic instance methods.
Since they cannot refer to type variables of a generic class, the constraint to avoid type variables with equal names (see <xref linkend="Req-IDE-55"/>) does not need to hold for generic static methods.</simpara>

<simpara>

A member <literal>M</literal> defined in an interface <literal>I</literal> is <emphasis>consumed</emphasis> by an implementor <literal>C</literal>, if it becomes a member of the class, that is, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>M</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></math>.</simpara>
<simpara>A member <literal>M</literal> is consumed if there is no member defined in the implementor with the same name and if there is no non-private,
non-abstract member with that name inherited by the implementor from its superclass. <footnote><simpara>There had been the idea of preventing static members of being consumed. However, this would break the type subtype relation.</simpara></footnote></simpara>
<simpara>If the implementor defines the member itself, then the member is implemented rather than consumed.</simpara>
<simpara>The concrete rules are described in the following;</simpara>
<simpara>It is not always possible to directly consume a member.
In general, a rather conservative strategy is used: if two implemented interfaces define the same (non-abstract) member then the implementor must redefine the member in order to solve conflicts.
Even if the two conflicting members have the same types, the implementor must redefine them as we generally assume semantic differences which the consumer has to be aware of.
Data fields defined in interfaces, in particular, are assumed to be concrete.
It is not, therefore, possible to consume a field defined in two implemented interfaces.</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>There may be several methods <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>M</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo>.</mo><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>.</mo><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>.</mo><mspace width="1.0mm"/><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> defined in different implemented interfaces and a single owned method <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mi>M</mi><mi>'</mi></msup></math> in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></msub></math>.

This is possible by using union types for the arguments and an intersection type as return type.
Such a method <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mi>M</mi><mi>'</mi></msup></math> is said to <emphasis>resolve</emphasis> the conflict between the implemented (and also inherited) methods.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Since abstracts methods may become part of the implementor methods, the implementor must either define these methods or it must be declared abstract itself.
Since interfaces are abstract by default, responsibility for implementing abstract methods is passed on to any implementor of interfaces.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If two implemented interfaces provide (non-abstract) members with the same name, they are not automatically consumed by the implementor even if the types would be similar.

<simpara>There is currently no separate annotation to indicate that methods are implemented or overridden in order to solve conflicts.
We always use the <literal>@Override</literal> annotation.</simpara>

</example>
<simpara>The columns describe different scenarios in which a method (with same name) is defined in different classifiers.
We assume that the defined methods are always non-abstract (i.e. have default implementations), non-private and have the same signature.
The last row shows which method will be actually used in class <literal>C</literal>.
If the method is defined in class <literal>C</literal>, and if this method is printed bold, then this means that the method is required to be defined in <literal>C</literal> in order to solve conflicts.</simpara>

<title>Structural Typing</title>
<simpara>In general, N4JS uses nominal typing.
This is to say that a duck is a duck only if it is declared to be a duck.
In particular when working with external APIs, it is more convenient to use structural or duck typing.
That is, a thing that can swim and quacks like a duck, is a duck.</simpara>
<simpara role="language-n4js">Interfaces or classes can be used for this purpose with a <emphasis>typing strategy modifier</emphasis>.
Given a type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>T</mi></math>, the simple <literal>~</literal> (tilde) can be added to its declaration (on definition-site) or in a reference (on use-site) to indicate that the type system should use structural typing
rather than nominal typing.<footnote><simpara>This kind of typing is used by TypeScript only. By defining a structural typed classifier or reference, it basically behaves as it would behave – without that modifier – in TypeScript.</simpara></footnote>
This means that some other type must provide the same members as type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>T</mi></math> to be deemed a structural subtype.
However, the operator cannot be used anymore with the type or reference as this operator relies on the declaration information (or at least the closest thing available at runtime).
In this case, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>T</mi></math> is, therefore, always a structural subtype of <emphasis>~T</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara role="language-n4js">Sometimes it is convenient to refer only to the fields of a classifier, for example when the initial field values are to be provided in a variable passed to the constructor.
In that case, the type can be modified with <literal>~~</literal> (two tildes). This is only possible on use-site, i.e. on type references.
Furthermore, only on the use-site, it is possible to consider only either readable or writable or fields by using the read-only <literal>~r~</literal> or write-only <literal>~w~</literal> structural field typing.
For initialization blocks, it is even possible to use structural initializer field typing via the <literal>~i~</literal> operator.</simpara>

<simpara>An interface or class can be defined to be used with structural typing by adding the structural modifier to its definition (or, in case of external classes, to the declaration).
This changes the default type system strategy from nominal to structural typing for that type.

<title>Use-Site Structural Typing</title>
<simpara>Use-site structural typing offers several typing strategy modifiers to define the accessability of public properties of classes and interfaces.
They can be used e.g. on variable declarations like this: <literal>var c : ~C</literal>.
The table <xref linkend="tab:available-fields-of-structural-types"/> shows which properties of structural types can be accessed in the different type strategies.
For example, when using the write-only structural strategy (i.e. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>~</mi><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>w</mtext></mstyle><mi>~</mi><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>X</mtext></mstyle></math>), only the writeable fields, can be accessed for writing.
In the table, the term field to both, public datafields and accessors of type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>X</mi></math>.
Non-public properties are never accessable in use-site structural types.
In any field-structural type, methods of the referenced nominal type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>X</mi></math> are not available.
The initializer structural typing provides readable fields for every writeable field of the references type.</simpara>

12. Use-site structural typing cannot be used for declaring supertypes of classes or interfaces.
That is to say that structural types cannot be used after <literal>extends</literal>, <literal>implements</literal> or <literal>with</literal> in type declarations <footnote><simpara>This is already constrained by the grammar.</simpara></footnote>.</simpara>
</requirement>
<simpara>Note that all members of <literal>N4Object</literal> are excluded.
This implies that extended reflective features (cf. <xref linkend="_reflection-meta-information"/> ) are not available in the context of structural typing.
The <literal>instanceof</literal> operator is still working as described in <xref linkend="_relational-expression"/>, in that it can be used to check the type of an instance.</simpara>
<simpara>If a type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>X</mi></math> is a (nominal) subtype of T, it is, of course, also a subtype of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>~</mi><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>T</mtext></mstyle></math>:</simpara>

If a type is structurally typed on both definition and use-site, the rules for
use-site structural typing (<xref linkend="Req-IDE-76"/>) are
applied.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Use-Site Structural Typing</title>
<simpara>The following example demonstrates the effect of the structural (field) modifier, used in this case for function parameters.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface I { public x: number; public foo()};
class C { public x: number; public foo() {}};

function n(p: I) {}
function f(p: ~I) {}
function g(p: ~~I) {}

n(new C());     // error: nominal typing, C does not implement I
f(new C());     // ok: C is a (structural) subtype of ~I
f({x:10});      // error, the object literal does not provide function foo()
g({x:10});      // ok: object literal provides all fields of I</programlisting>
</example>
<example>
<title>Structural types variable and instanceof operator</title>
<simpara>It is possible to use a variable typed with a structural version of a type on the left hand side of the <literal>instanceof</literal> operator, as demonstrated in this example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {
    public x;
    public betterX() { return this.x||1;}
}

function f(p: ~~C) {
    if (p instanceof C) {
        console.log((p as C).betterX);
    } else {
        console.log(p.x||1);
    }
}</programlisting>

<title>Structural Read-only, Write-only and Initializer Field Typing</title>
<simpara>Structural read-only, write-only and initializer field typings are extensions of structural field typing.
Everything that is defined for the field structural typing must comply with these extension field typings.
For the read-only type, readable fields (mutable and <literal>@Final</literal> ones) and setters are considered, for the write-only type; only the setters and mutable fields are considered.
Due to the hybrid nature of the initializer type it can act two different ways.
To be more precise, a type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>X</mi></math> (structural initializer field type) is a supertype of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>Y</mi></math> (structural initializer field type) if for each public, non-static, non-optional writable field (mutable data field of setter) of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>X</mi></math>, there is a corresponding, public, non-static readable field of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>Y</mi></math>.
All public member fields with <literal>@Final</literal> annotation are considered to be mandatory in the initializer field typing  <literal>@Spec</literal> constructors.
The already-initialized <literal>@Final</literal> fields can be either omitted from, or can be re-initialized via, an initializer field typing <literal>@Spec</literal> style constructor.</simpara>

<title>Public Setter Annotated With <literal>ProvidesInitializer</literal></title>
<simpara>Public setters with <literal>ProvidesInitializer</literal> annotation can declare optional fields implemented by means of field accessors instead of data fields.
Data fields with an initializer are treated as optional in the initializer field type.</simpara>
<simpara>It is important to note that it is valid to use the <literal>ProvidesInitializer</literal> annotation for setters in <literal>n4js</literal> files and not only definition files.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Setters with <literal>@ProvidesInitializer</literal> treated as optional</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {
    private _y: int = 1;

    public get y() { return this._y; }
    @ProvidesInitializer
    public set y(v: int) { this._y = v; }

    public constructor(@Spec spec: ~i~this) { }
}

console.log(new C({}).y); // 1
console.log(new C({y: 42}).y); //24</programlisting>
</example>

<section xml:id="_structural-types-with-optional-fields" role="language-n4js">
<title>Structural Types With Optional Fields</title>
<simpara>Public optional fields become a member of the structural (field) type as
well. To ensure the overall type safety, the semantics of optionality (e.g. on or off) depends on the context, in which the optional fields are currently being used (See <link linkend="optional-fields">Optional Fields</link>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_structural-types-with-access-modifier" role="language-n4js">
<title>Structural Types With Access Modifier</title>
<simpara>The access modifier of the subtype have to provide equal or higher
visibility.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Access modifier in structural typing</title>

    <simpara>
</simpara>
<simpara>It is only possible to add additional members to a type if use-site structural typing is used.</simpara>
<simpara>The following constraints must hold:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>For all additional members defined in a structural type reference, the constraints for member overriding (<xref linkend="Req-IDE-72"/>) apply as well.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>All additional members have the access modifier set to <literal>public</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Type variables must not be augmented with additional structural members.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Additional fields may be declared optional in the same way as fields in classes.
The rules given in <xref linkend="_structural-types-with-optional-fields"/> apply accordingly.
Consider the following example:</simpara>
</requirement>
<example>
<title>Additional optional members in structural typing</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {
    public f1: number;
}

var c1: ~C with { f3: string; } c1;
var c2: ~C with { f3: string?; } c2;

c1 = { f1:42 };  // error: "~Object with { number f1; } is not a subtype of ~C with { string f3; }."
c2 = { f1:42 };  // ok!!</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Augmenting a type variable T with additional structural members can cause collisions with another member of a type argument for T.
Hence, type variables must not be augmented with additional structural members like in the following example.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Forbidden additional structural members on type variables</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface I&lt;T&gt; {
    public field : ~T with {prop : int} // error "No additional structural members allowed on type variables."
}</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Using an additional structural member on a type variable T could be seen as a constraint to T.
However, constraints like this should be rather stated using an explicit interface like in the example below.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Use explicitly defined Interfaces</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface ~J {
    prop : int;
}
interface II&lt;T extends J&gt; {
}</programlisting>

<title>Properties</title>
<simpara>In any case, a function type declares the signature of a function and allows validation of calls to that function.
A function type has the following properties:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>typePars</literal>  </term>
<listitem>
<simpara>(0-indexed) list of type parameters (i.e. type variables) for generic functions.</simpara>

<term><literal>fpars</literal>  </term>
<listitem>
<simpara>(0-indexed) list of formal parameters.</simpara>

<varlistentry>
<term><literal>name</literal> </term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Name of function or method, may be empty or automatically generated (for messages).</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>body</literal> </term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The body of the function, it contains statements <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></math>.
The body is null if a function type is defined in a type expression, and it is the last argument in case of a function object constructor, or the content of the function definition body.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>Additionally, the following pseudo properties for functions are defined:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>thisTypeRef</literal> </term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The this type ref is the type to which the <literal>this</literal>-keyword would be evaluated
if used inside the function or member. The inference rules are described
in <xref linkend="_this-keyword"/>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>fpars</literal> </term>
<listitem>
<simpara>List of formal parameters and the this type ref.
This is only used for sub typing rules.
If <literal>this</literal> is not used inside the function, then <literal>any</literal> is set instead of the inferred thisTypeRef to allow for more usages.
The property is computed as follows:</simpara>

However, in JavaScript it is
possible to call a function with any number of arguments independently
from how many formal parameters the function defines.</simpara>
<simpara>If a function does not define a return type, <literal>any</literal> is assumed if at least one
of the (indirectly) contained return statements contains an expression.
Otherwise <literal>void</literal> is assumed. This is also true if there is an error due to
other constraint violations.</simpara>

<title>Function type conformance</title>
<simpara>The following incomplete snippet demonstrates the usage of two function variables <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></math>, in which <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mo>[</mo><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mrow><mo>[</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>:</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mrow><mo>[</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mspace width="-0.167em"/><mo>]</mo></mrow></math> must hold true according to the aforementioned constraints.
A function <literal>bar</literal> declares a parameter <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></math>, which is actually a function itself.
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></math> is a variable, to which a function expression is a assigned.
Function <literal>bar</literal> is then called with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></math> as an argument.
Thus, the type of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></math> must be a subtype of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></math>’s type.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">function bar(f1: {function(A,B):C}) { ... }

var f2: {function(A,B):C} = function(p1,p2){...};
bar(f1);</programlisting>

<simpara>The type of <literal>this</literal> can be explicitly set via the <literal>@This</literal> annotation.</simpara>

<title>Subtyping with function types</title>
<simpara>If classes A, B, and C are defined as previously mentioned, i.e. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>C</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>:</mi><mi>B</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>:</mi><mi>A</mi></math>, then
the following subtyping relations with function types are to be evaluated as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">       {function(B):B} &lt;: {function(B):B}           -&gt; true
        {function():A} &lt;: {function():B}            -&gt; false
        {function():C} &lt;: {function():B}            -&gt; true
         {function(A)} &lt;: {function(B)}             -&gt; true

{function():undefined} &lt;: {function():B}            -&gt; true</programlisting>
<simpara>The following examples demonstrate the effect of optional and variadic parameters:</simpara>

{function(A...)} &lt;: {function()}                    -&gt; true (!)</programlisting>
<simpara>The following examples demonstrate the effect of optional return types:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">{function():void} &lt;: {function():void}              -&gt; true
{function():X}    &lt;: {function():void}              -&gt; true

<simpara>Note that the upper bounds on the left must be supertypes of the right-side upper bounds (for similar reasons why types of formal parameters on the left are
required to be supertypes of the formal parameters’ types in ).
Where a particular type variable is used, on co- or contra-variant position, is not relevant:</simpara>
<example>
<title>Bounded type variable at co-variant position in function type</title>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {}
class B extends A {}

class X {
    &lt;T extends B&gt; m(): T { return null; }
}
class Y extends X {
    @Override
    &lt;T extends A&gt; m(): T { return null; }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Method <literal>m</literal> in <literal>Y</literal> may return an <literal>A</literal>, thus breaking the contract of m in <literal>X</literal>, but only if it is parameterized to do so, which is not allowed for clients of <literal>X</literal>, only those of <literal>Y</literal>.
Therefore, the override in the above example is valid.</simpara>
</example>
<simpara>The subtype relation for function types is also applied for method overriding to ensure that an overriding method’s signature conforms to that of the overridden method,
see <xref linkend="Req-IDE-72"/> (applies to method comnsumption and implementation accordingly, see <xref linkend="Req-IDE-73"/> and <xref linkend="Req-IDE-74"/>).
Note that this is very different from Java which is far more restrictive when checking overriding methods.
As Java also supports method overloading: given two types <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>A</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>B</mi></math> with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>B</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>:</mi><mi>A</mi></math> and a super class method <literal>void m(B param)</literal>, it is valid to override <literal>m</literal> as <literal>void m(A param)</literal> in N4JS but not in Java.
In Java this would be handled as method overloading and therefore an <literal>@Override</literal> annotation on <literal>m</literal> would produce an error.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_semantics-and-type-inference">
<title>Semantics and Type Inference</title>
<simpara>In general, the inferred type of a function expression simply is the function type as described in <xref linkend="_function-type"/>.
Often, the signature of a function expression is not explicitly specified but it can be inferred from the context.
The following context information is used to infer the full signature:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>If the function expression is used on the right hand side of an assignment, the expected return type can be inferred from the left hand side.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If the function expression is used as an argument in a call to another function, the full signature can be inferred from the corresponding type of the formal parameter declaration.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Although the signature of the function expression may be inferred from the formal parameter if the function expression is used as argument, this inference has some conceptual limitations.
This is demonstrated in the next example.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Inference Of Function Expression’s Signature</title>
<simpara>In general, <literal>{function():any}</literal> is a subtype of <literal>{function():void}</literal> (cf. <xref linkend="_function-type"/>).
When the return type of a function expression is inferred, this relation is taken into account which may lead to unexpected results as shown in the following code snippet:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">function f(cb: {function():void}) { cb() }
f(function() { return 1; });</programlisting>
<simpara>No error is issued: The type of the function expression actually is inferred to <literal>{function():any}</literal>, because there is a return statement with an expression.
It is not inferred to <literal>{function():void}</literal>, even if the formal parameter of <literal>f</literal> suggests that.
Due to the previously-stated relation <literal>{function():any} &lt;: {function():void}</literal> this is correct – the client (in this
case function <literal>f</literal>) works perfectly well even if <literal>cb</literal> returns something.
The contract of arguments states that the type of the argument is a subtype of the type of the formal parameter.
This is what the inferencer takes into account!</simpara>

<title>Formal Parameters</title>
<simpara>Parameter handling has been significantly upgraded in ECMAScript 6.
It now supports parameter default values, rest parameters (variadics) and destructuring.
Formal parameters can be modified to be either default or variadic.
In case a formal parameter has no modifier, it is called normal.
Modified parameters also become optional.</simpara>
<simpara>Modifiers of formal parameters such as default or rest are neither evaluated nor rewritten in the transpiler.</simpara>
<section xml:id="Type_Modifiers_Optional">
<title>Optional Parameters</title>
<simpara>An optional formal parameter can be omitted when calling a function/method.
An omitted parameter has the value <literal>undefined</literal>.
In case the omitted parameter is variadic, the value is an empty array.</simpara>
<simpara>Parameters can not be declared as optional explicitly.
Instead, being optional is true when a parameter is declared as default or variadic.
Note that any formal parameter that follows a default parameter is itself also a default thus an optional parameter.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="Type_Modifiers_Default">
<title>Default Parameters</title>
<simpara>A default parameter value is specified for a parameter via an equals sign (<literal>=</literal>).
If a caller doesn’t provide a value for the parameter, the default value is used.</simpara>
<simpara>Default initializers of parameters are specified at a formal parameter of a function or method after the equal sign using an arbitrary initializer expression, such as <literal>var = "s"</literal>.
However, this default initializer can be omitted.
When a formal parameter has a declared type, the default initializer is specified at the end, such as: <literal>var : string = "s"</literal>.
The initializer expression is only evaluated in case no actual argument is given for the formal parameter.
Also, the initializer expression is evaluated when the actual argument value is <literal>undefined</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Formal parameters become default parameters implicitly when they are preceded by an explicit default parameter.
In such cases, the default initializer is <literal>undefined</literal>.</simpara>

The ECMAScript Specification calls this a function definition even though they may only appear in the context of expressions.</simpara>
<simpara>Along with Assignments, Arrow function expressions have the least precedence, e.g. they serve as the entry point for the expression tree.</simpara>
<simpara>Arrow function expressions can be considered syntactic window-dressing for old-school function expressions and therefore do not support the
benefits regarding parameter annotations although parameter types may be given explicitly.
The return type can be given as type hint if desired, but this is not mandatory (if left out, the return type is inferred).

<simpara>If the expression after an <literal>await</literal> evaluates to a <literal>Promise</literal>, execution of the enclosing asynchronous function will be suspended until either a success value is available

or until the Promise is rejected (which will then cause an exception to be thrown at the location of the await-expression).
If, on the other hand, the expression after an <literal>await</literal> evaluates to a non-promise, the value will be simply passed through.
In addition, a warning is shown to indicate the unnecessary <literal>await</literal> expression.</simpara>
<simpara>Note how method <literal>loadAddress()</literal> above can be implemented without any explicit references to the built-in type Promise.
In the above example we handle the errors of the nested asynchronous calls to <literal>getDataBase()</literal> and <literal>loadEntry()</literal> for demonstration purposes only;

<section xml:id="_promisifiable-functions">
<title>Promisifiable Functions</title>
<simpara>In many existing libraries, which have been developed in pre-ES6-promise-API times, callback methods are used for asynchronous behavior.
An asynchronous function follows the following conventions:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">'function' name '(' arbitraryParameters ',' callbackFunction ')'</programlisting>
<simpara>Usually the function returns nothing (<literal>void</literal>).
The callback function usually takes two arguments,in which the first is an error object and the other is the result value of the asynchronous operation.
The callback function is called from the asynchronous function, leading to nested function calls (aka ’callback hell’).</simpara>
<simpara>In order to simplify usage of this pattern, it is possible to mark such a function or method as <literal>@Promisifiable</literal>.
It is then possible to ’promisify’ an invocation of this function or method, which means no callback function argument has to be provided and a will be returned.
The function or method can then be used as if it were declared with <literal>async</literal>.
This is particularly useful in N4JS definition files (.n4jsd) to allow using an existing callback-based API from N4JS code with the more convenient <literal>await</literal>.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Promisifiable</title>
<simpara>Given a function with an N4JS signature</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">f(x: int, cb: {function(Error, string)}): void</programlisting>
<simpara>This method can be annotated with <literal>Promisifiable</literal> as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Promisifiable f(x: int, cb: {function(Error, string)}): void</programlisting>
<simpara>With this annotation, the function can be invoked in four different
ways:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">f(42, function(err, result1) { /* ... */ });            // traditional
var promise: Promise&lt;string,Error&gt; = @Promisify f(42);  // promise
var result3: string = await @Promisify f(42);           // long
var result4: string = await f(42);                      // short</programlisting>
<simpara>The first line is only provided for completeness and shows that a promisifiable function can still be used in the ordinary way by providing a callback - no special handling will occur in this case.
The second line shows how <literal>f</literal> can be promisified using the <literal>@Promisify</literal> annotation - no callback needs to be provided and instead, a <literal>Promise</literal> will be returned.
We can either use this promise directly or immediately <literal>await</literal> on it, as shown in line 3.
The syntax shown in line 4 is merely shorthand for <literal>await @Promisify</literal>, i.e. the annotation is optional after <literal>await</literal>.</simpara>

<title>Conversions and Reflection</title>
<section xml:id="_autoboxing-and-coercing" role="language-n4js">
<title>Autoboxing and Coercing</title>
<simpara>Coercing is the ability to implicitly cast one (primitive) type to another.
Autoboxing is a special kind of coercing in that is the ability to automatically convert a primitive value type, such as <literal>string</literal>, <literal>number</literal>, or <literal>boolean</literal>,
to its corresponding Object type version <literal>String</literal>, <literal>Number</literal>, <literal>Boolean</literal>.
The capital letters in the latter are an essential distinction.</simpara>
<simpara>Conversion between primitives and object-representations of a datatype are not automatic in N4JS. Only in the cases of object-method invocations on a primitive type
(for <literal>string</literal> to call <literal>"abc".length</literal>, for example) automatic conversion is applied.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that N4JS specific primitive types <literal>pathselector</literal> and <literal>i18nkey</literal> are handled similarly to <literal>string</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_coercing">
<title>Coercing</title>
<simpara>In [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a</link>], coercing is defined by means of the abstract specification method <literal>ToPrimitive</literal> [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S9.1)</link>], also see [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S9.10)</link>]).
Other conversions, such as <literal>ToNumber</literal>, are not directly supported but reflected in the typing rules of expressions.</simpara>
<simpara>We express absence of automatic coercion here by means of subtype
relations:</simpara>

<simpara>If a conversion between primitive and object type is desired, we require the user of N4JS to actively convert the values.
The reason for that is the notably different behavior of object- and primitive-variants of a type in expression evaluation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var bool: boolean = false;
var Bool: Boolean = new Boolean( false );

console.log( bool ? "true" : "false"); // prints "false"
console.log( Bool ? "true" : "false"); // prints "true"!</programlisting>
<simpara>Conversion between a primitive type to its object-variant is achieved by the <literal>new</literal> operator.
The <literal>valueOf()</literal> method converts the object-variant back to a primitive value.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">// objects from literals:
var bo: Boolean = new Boolean( true ); // typeof bo: object
var no: Number = new Number( 42 ); // typeof no: object
var so: String = new String( "foo" ); // typeof so: object

// to primitive
var b: boolean = bo.valueOf(); // typeof b: boolean -- true
var n: number = no.valueOf(); // typeof n: number -- 42
var s: string = so.valueOf(); // typeof s: string -- "foo"

// to object-type
bo = new Boolean( b );
no = new Number( n );
so = new String( s );</programlisting>
<simpara>Conversion of variables of type <literal>Object</literal> or from one primitive type to another is expressed in terms of typing rules for expressions.
That is, it is not possible to convert any <literal>Object</literal> to a primitive in general, but it is possible to do so in the context of certain expressions such as additive operator.
The applied conversions are described in <xref linkend="_auto-conversion-of-class-instances"/></simpara>
</section>

<simpara>Autoboxing is not directly supported in N4JS. Instead, primitive types virtually have the same members as their corresponding object types.
It is then possible to use the Autoboxing feature when calling a member.
In general, Autoboxing is only supported for accessing built-in read-only (immutable) properties.
For example, <literal>"some string value".split(" ");</literal> is supported but <literal>"some string value".foo=1;</literal> will be rejected as String does not allow properties to be added (cf. <literal>String</literal> vs. <literal>String+</literal>, see <xref linkend="_dynamic"/>).</simpara>
<simpara>Autoboxing often leads to problems, in particular in combination with dynamic types – this is why it is not directly supported in N4JS.</simpara>

That is, in most cases, no extra hint is passed to <literal>DefaultValue</literal>. Thus <literal>valueOf</literal> usually takes precedence over toString as demonstrated in the following example:</simpara>
<example>
<title>Auto-Conversion</title>
<simpara>Assume some classes and corresponding instances defined as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {}
class B{
    @Override public toString(): string { return "MyB"}
}
class C{
    @Override public valueOf(): any { return 10}
}
class D{
    @Override public toString(): string { return "MyD"}
    @Override public valueOf(): any { return 20}
}
var a = new A(), b = new B(), c = new C(), d = new D();</programlisting>
<simpara>Instances of these classes will be converted as demonstrated as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">console.log(a+"");                      // [object Object]
console.log(a+1);                       // [object Object]1

console.log(""+b+"");                   // MyB
console.log(1+b+1);                     // 1MyB1

console.log(c+"");                      // 10
console.log(c+1);                       // 11

console.log(d+"");                      // 20
console.log(d+1);                       // 21</programlisting>

<section xml:id="_type-check">
<title>Type Check</title>
<simpara>There are basically two ways of testing the type of a variable: <literal>typeof</literal> and <literal>instanceof</literal>.
N4JS supports type comparison via the ECMAScript <literal>instanceof</literal> operator.
The operator <literal>instanceof</literal> retains its standard ECMAScript behavior (e.g. checking whether a value is an instance of a constructor function), but has additional functionality when used with N4JS types.</simpara>
<simpara>When used with an N4JS class, <literal>instanceof</literal> also supports checking against an interface. For N4JS enumeration values, it can be used to check whether the value is part of a specific enumeration.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>typeof</literal> only returns a string with the name of the ECMAScript type, which is <literal>Object</literal> for all class instances.</simpara>
<simpara>N4JS specific <literal>string</literal> types, that is <literal>pathSelector</literal> and <literal>i18nkey</literal> cannot be tested during runtime.
These types, therefore, must not be used in <literal>instanceof</literal> expressions.
The same is true for string-based enums and arrays which cannot be tested during runtime, thus string-based enum and array types are not permitted on the right-hand side of <literal>instancesof</literal> constructs.
For all types for which the evaluation result of <literal>instanceof</literal> could be computed at compile time, the check is unnecessary and thus it is refused by the compiler.
Using structural types on the right-hand side of <literal>instancesof</literal> constructs is also not permitted.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to avoid errors at runtime, the <literal>instanceof</literal> operator defines appropriate constraints, see <xref linkend="_relational-expression"/> for details.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Type Check Example</title>
<simpara>Given the following classes and variable:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">interface I{}
class S{}
class Sub extends S implements I{}

var x = new Sub();</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara><literal>typeof x</literal> will simply return <literal>object</literal>. The following table shows the difference between plain JavaScript <literal>instanceof</literal> and N4JS’s <literal>instanceof</literal>:</simpara>

<simpara>In addition, the static method <literal>of</literal> in <literal>N4Type</literal> is available to retrieve the meta-information for a given instance or

<section xml:id="_ecmascript-5-expressions" role="language-n4js">
<title>ECMAScript 5 Expressions</title>
<simpara>N4JS supports the same expressions as ECMAScript.
The semantics are described in [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S11)</link>].
In N4JS, some expressions are extended for supporting the declaration of types, annotations, or parameterized usages.
These extensions and type-related aspects as well as specific N4JS constraints are described in this section.</simpara>
<simpara>Some operators come in different ’flavors’, that is as binary operator, unary pre- or postfix operators, or assignment operators.
For these operators, type constraints are only defined for the binary operator version and the other variants are deduced to that binary version.
E.g., <literal>++</literal> and <literal>+=</literal> are deduced to <literal>+</literal> (and simple assignment).</simpara>

<simpara>The use of <literal>this</literal> is illustrated with some examples as it can often be confusing.
Type inference heuristics and explanations are provided in the next section.</simpara>
<example>
<title>This in Unrestricted Mode</title>
<simpara>In unrestricted mode, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the receiver.
If there is no receiver it is bound to the global object, however, we often do not know exactly what the global object would be.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var name = "global a"; // assume the top level is similar to the global object
this.name; // &lt;-- "global a"
function f() {
    return this.name; // &lt;-- depends on call, usually "global a"
}
var ol1 = {
    name: "John",
    greeting: "Hello " + this.name, // "Hello global a" -- we do not greet John!
}
var ol2 = {
    name: "John",
    f: function() {
        this.name; // usually "John", as we assume f is called like ol2.f()
        var g = function() {
           return this.name; // "global a"
        }
        return g(); // no receiver, this in nested function g will be global scope
    }
}</programlisting>
</example>
<example>
<title>This in strict mode</title>
<simpara>In strict mode, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the receiver.
If there is no receiver, it is bound to <literal>undefined</literal>.
Thus, we will probably get a lot of errors:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">"use strict"
var name = "global a"; // assume the top level is similar to the global object
this.name; // &lt;-- error, this is undefined, there is no receiver
function f() {
    return this.name; // &lt;-- depends on call, usually this produces an error as this is undefined
}
var ol1 = {
    name: "John",
    greeting: "Hello " + this.name, // will produce an error, as this is undefined
}
var ol2 = {
    name: "John",
    f: function() {
        this.name; // usually "John", as we assume f is called like ol2.f()
        var g = function() {
           this.name; // an error, see call below:
        }
        return g(); // no receiver, this in nested function g is undefined
    }
}</programlisting>
</example>
<example>
<title>This in N4JS mode</title>
<simpara>As in strict mode, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the receiver and if there is no receiver, it is bound to <literal>undefined</literal>. So the example above is also true for N4JS mode.
Classes behave slightly differently:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {
    name = "John";
    greeting  = "Hello " + this.name; // works, in N4JS classes, greeting is "Hello John"

    f() {
        return this.name; // this usually is instance object, similar to object literals.
    }

    g() {
        var h = function() {
            return this.name; // as in object literals: no receiver, no this.
        }
        return h();
    }
}</programlisting>

<note>
<simpara>In N4JS classes, <literal>this</literal> is always bound to the instance when used in field initialization.</simpara>
</note>
<bridgehead xml:id="_type-inference-2" renderas="sect4">Type Inference</bridgehead>
<simpara>The type is inferred from the <literal>this</literal> type is bound to. The inference,
therefore, has to consider the original semantics as described in [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.10.4., p.10.4.3, p.p.58)</link>].
In ECMAScript the type of this is unfortunately determined by the function call and not by the function definition:</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>By default, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the global object [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.10.4.1.1)</link>].

<simpara>Actually, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the newly created object if a function is called with the <literal>new</literal> operator.

<title>This and Function Expressions</title>
<simpara>In this example a function is created via a function expression.
The function is then assigned to member field of class B.
Via annotating the expression with <literal>@This(B)</literal>, access to the receiver of type B is enabled.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class B {
    log(): string { return "B was logged"; }     // method
    logMe : {@This(B) function():void}; // reference to a function
}

var b: B = new B();
b.logMe = @This(B) function() { console.log("*&gt;"+this.log()+"&lt;*"); }
b.logMe(); // prints "*&gt;B was logged&lt;*"</programlisting>

<simpara>Note that if a function is called as a constructor function with new, the
type of <literal>this</literal> can be declared via annotation <literal>@This(..)</literal>, as shown in the following
snippet:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">@This(
    ~Object with {
        w: number; h: number;
        area: {function():number};
    })
function Box(w: number w, h: number) {
    this.w = w;
    this.h = h;
    this.area = @This(
        ~Object with {
            w: number; h: number;
            area: {function():number};
        }) function() { return this.w * this.h }
}
var bError = Box(1,2)
var bOK = new Box(1,2)</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Inside the constructor function <literal>Box</literal>, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the structural type definition due to the annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>Inside the nested function <literal>area</literal>, <literal>this</literal> is bound to the receiver object (if the function is called like <literal>bOk.area()</literal>).
Again, this depends on the way the nested function is called, which can usually not be determined at the declaration location.
The nested function must then be annotated accordingly.</simpara>
<simpara>When calling this function, the type of this is checked against the declared this type, which would cause an error in the first case.</simpara>
<simpara>The use of the <literal>@This</literal> annotation is not allowed on methods.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>Using constructor functions is not recommended and an error or warning will be created.
This is only useful for adapting third-party library code.
Even in the latter case, it would probably make more sense to declare a (library) <emphasis role="strong">class</emphasis> Rectangle rather then defining the constructor function.</simpara>

<simpara>The type of an identifier <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>i</mi></math> is resolved depending on its binding and scope respectively (cf. [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.10.2.2.1GetIdentifierReference, p.p.56)</link>].
The following scopes (aka <emphasis>Lexical Environments</emphasis>) are defined:</simpara>

<simpara>Note that classes definitions and object literal do not define a scope: members of a class or properties of an object literal are to be accessed via <literal>this</literal>.
Identifier references always reference declared elements, that is to say either variable, function, or class declarations.

<simpara>In general, an array literal is inferred as <literal>Array&lt;T&gt;</literal> (similar to the type of <literal>new Array()</literal>).
The interesting question is the binding of the type variable <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>T</mi></math>.</simpara>
<simpara>The type of an array padding <emphasis>p</emphasis> is inferred as follows:</simpara>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mfrac><mrow/><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>p</mi><mi>:</mi><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>undefined</mtext></mstyle></mrow></mfrac><mtext>
</mtext></math>
<simpara>The element type of an array literal is simply inferred as the (simplified) union of the type elements of the array.
Thus, the type of an array literal <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>a</mi></math> is inferred as follows:</simpara>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mfrac><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>.</mo><mover accent="true"><mrow><mi>e</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow><mo>¯</mo></mover><mi>:</mi><mover accent="true"><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo>¯</mo></mover><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>⋃</mo><mover accent="true"><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo>¯</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mfenced close=")" open="("><mi>a</mi></mfenced><mi>:</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow></mfrac></math>
<simpara>In other languages not supporting union types, the element type is often inferred as the join (<link linkend="_acronyms">LCST</link>) of the element types.
Using a union type here preserves more information (as the actual types are still known).
For many use cases the behavior is similar though, as the members of a union type are the members of the join of the elements of the union.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that <literal>typeof [1,2,3]</literal> does not return <literal>Array&lt;number&gt;</literal> (as ECMAScript is not aware of the generic array type), but <literal>Object</literal>.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Array Type Inference</title>
<simpara>The type for all variables declared in this example is inferred to <literal>Array&lt;string&gt;</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var names1          = ["Walter", "Werner"];
var names2          = new Array("Wim", "Wendelin");
var names3          = new Array&lt;string&gt;(3); // length is 3
var names4: Array&lt;string&gt;;</programlisting>
<simpara>Empty array literals are inferred to <literal>any</literal>, by default.
We are not using <literal>Array&lt;?&gt;</literal> here because then a typical JavaScript pattern would no longer be supported:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var a = [];
a.push('hello'); <co xml:id="CO4-1"/></programlisting>
<calloutlist>
<callout arearefs="CO4-1">
<para>This would fail if <literal>a</literal> and thus <literal>[]</literal> were inferred to <literal>Array&lt;?&gt;</literal></para>
</callout>
</calloutlist>
</example>
<important>

<simpara>A generic method invocation may be parameterized as well.
This is rarely required as the function argument types are usually inferred from the given arguments.
In some cases, for instance with pathSelectors, this is useful.
In that case, the type variable defined in the generic method declaration is explicitly bound to types by using type arguments.
See <xref linkend="_property-accessors"/> for semantics and type inference.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Generic Method Invocation</title>
<simpara>This examples demonstrate how to explicitly
define the type argument in a method call in case it cannot be inferred
automatically.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class C {
    static &lt;T&gt; foo(p: pathSelector&lt;T&gt;): void {..}
};
C.&lt;my.Address&gt;foo("street.number");</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that in many cases, the type inferencer should be able to infer the type automatically.
For example, for a method</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">function &lt;T&gt; bar(c: T, p: pathSelector&lt;T&gt;): void {..};</programlisting>
<simpara>and a function call</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">bar(context, "some.path.selector");
[source,n4js]</programlisting>
<simpara>the type variable <literal>T</literal> can be automatically bound to the type of variable <literal>context</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>In JavaScript it is possible to subtract two non-numerics, leading to <literal>NaN</literal>. Also <literal>undefined</literal> or <literal>null</literal> may be used. The real difference is what type is to be returned (string or number, see below).</simpara>

<simpara role="language-n4js">The type of an additive expression is usually inferred to <literal>number</literal>, except for addition which may lead to string as well.
The result for the addition operator is only be a number if both operands are numbers, booleans, null, or undefined.
Using <literal>undefined</literal> in an additive expression leads to <literal>NaN</literal> which actually is a number from the type system&#8217;s point of view. Additional analysis may create errors in the latter case though.</simpara>

<simpara>That is, if both operands are number, int, boolean, null, or even undefined, then the 'plus' is interpreted as
mathematical addition and the result is a number. In other cases the 'plus' is interpreted as string concatenation and the result is a string. In case of union types, the result may be a union of number and string.</simpara>
<simpara>Adding two integers (int) leads to a number, since the result may not be represented as an (JavaScript) int anymore.</simpara>

<simpara>A special feature of N4JS is support for interface type references in combination with the <literal>instance of</literal> operator.
The compiler rewrites the code to make this work.</simpara>
<example>
<title><literal>instanceof</literal> with Interface</title>
<simpara>The following example demonstrates the use of the operator with an interface.
This is, of course, not working in pure ECMAScript.</simpara>

<simpara>Similarly to [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S11.1, p.p.84ff)</link>], we define type inference for simple assignment (<literal>=</literal>) and compound assignment (<literal>op=</literal>) individually.</simpara>
<simpara>The type of the assignment is simply the type of the right-hand side:</simpara>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mspace width="3.0mm"/><mfrac><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>:</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>t</mi><mi> </mi><mstyle mathvariant="monospace"><mtext>’=’</mtext></mstyle><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>:</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>
<simpara>Compound assignments are reduced to the former by splitting an operator <literal>@=</literal>, in which <literal>@</literal> is a simple operator,
into a simple operator expression with operator <literal>@</literal> and a simple assignment <literal>=</literal>.
Since the type of the latter is the right-hand side, we can define:</simpara>

<title>Compile-Time Expressions</title>
<simpara>A compile-time expression is an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile time. Not all expressions introduced
in the previous sections qualify as compile-time expressions. Some forms of expressions always qualify (e.g. a string
literal is always a compile-time expression), some never (e.g. call expressions), and for some expressions the operands
must be of a certain value. The latter applies, for example, to divison: <literal>5 / 0</literal> is a valid ECMAScript expression (evaluating
to <literal>NaN</literal>) but is not a compile-time expression. So it&#8217;s the actual compile-time value of the divisor that makes the difference,
here. In any case, if an expression has operands, it is a compile-time expression only if all operands are compile-time expressions.</simpara>
<simpara>The value a compile-time expression evaluates to at compile-time is called <emphasis>compile-time value</emphasis>. So, an expression has a compile-time
value if and only if it is a compile-time expression.</simpara>

<simpara>The first of the above constraints (the type required by the ’of’ part in a <literal>for &#8230;&#8203; of</literal> loop is <literal>Iterable</literal>) was changed during the definition of ECMAScript 6.
This is implemented differently in separate implementations and even in different versions of the same implementation (for instance in different versions of V8).

</note>
<simpara>Requiring an <literal>Iterable</literal> and not accepting a plain <literal>Iterator</literal> seems to be the final decision (as of Dec. 2014).

</orderedlist>
<simpara>These constraints define the error level when using dynamic import: we receive no error for <literal>js</literal>, a warning for <literal>n4jsd</literal>, and an error for <literal>n4js</literal> files.
The idea behind these distinct error levels is as follows:<?asciidoc-br?>
If only a plain <literal>js</literal> file is available, using the dynamic import is the only way to access elements from the <literal>js</literal> module.
This might be an unsafe way, but it allows the access and simplifies the first steps.
An <literal>n4jsd</literal> file may then be made available either by the developer using the <literal>js</literal> module or by a third-party library.
In this case, we do not want to break existing code.
There is only a warning created in the case of an available <literal>n4jsd</literal> file and a <literal>js</literal> file still must be provided by the user.
Having an <literal>n4js</literal> file is a completely different story; no <literal>n4jsd</literal> file is required, no <literal>js</literal> file is needed
(since the transpiler creates one from the <literal>n4js</literal> file) and there is absolutely no reason to use the module dynamically.</simpara>

<simpara>With regard to type inference, export statements are not handled at all.

<simpara>Declared elements (types, variables, functions) are usually only visible outside the declaring module if the elements are exported and imported (by the using module, cf. <xref linkend="_import-statement"/>).</simpara>
<simpara>Some special components (runtime environment and libraries, cf. <xref linkend="_runtime-environment-and-runtime-libraries"/>, may export elements globally.
This is done by annotating the export (or the whole module) with <literal>@Global</literal>, see <xref linkend="_global-definitions"/> for details.</simpara>
<simpara>By adding <literal>default</literal> after the keyword <literal>export</literal>, the identifiable element can be exported as ’the default’.

<simpara>Annotations are used to further define meta properties of language elements such as types, variables and functions.
These annotations are used by the compiler and validator to prohibit the developer from introducing constructs which are either not allowed or are unnecessary in certain contexts.</simpara>
<simpara>Since annotations are to be processed by the compiler and the compilation cannot be extended by third-party users for security reasons, annotations cannot be defined by developers.
Instead, the compiler comes with a predefined set of annotations which are summarized here.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_syntax-13">
<title>Syntax</title>
<simpara>Annotations are used similarly as in Java (although new annotations cannot be defined by the user).
They are formally defined as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xtext" linenumbering="unnumbered">Annotation:'@' AnnotationNoAtSign;
ScriptAnnotation returns Annotation: '@@' AnnotationNoAtSign;

AnnotationNoAtSign returns Annotation:
    name=AnnotationName (=&gt; '(' (args+=AnnotationArgument (',' args+=AnnotationArgument)*)? ')')?;

AnnotationArgument:
    LiteralAnnotationArgument | TypeRefAnnotationArgument

LiteralAnnotationArgument:

<title>Array and Object Destructuring</title>
<simpara>N4JS supports array and object destructuring as provided in ES6.
This is used to conveniently assign selected elements of an array or object to a number of newly-declared or pre-existing variables or to further destructure them by using nested

<simpara>The following example declares four variables <literal>a</literal>, <literal>b</literal>, <literal>x</literal>, and <literal>prop2</literal>. Variables <literal>a</literal> and <literal>x</literal> will have the value <literal>hello</literal>, whereas <literal>b</literal> and <literal>prop2</literal> will have value 42.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var [a,b] = ["hello", 42];

var {prop1:x, prop2} = {prop1:"hello", prop2:42};</programlisting>
<simpara>In the case of <literal>prop2</literal>, we do not provide a property name and variable name separately; this is useful in cases where the property name also makes for a
suitable variable name (called <literal>single name binding</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>One of the most useful use cases of destructuring is in a <literal>for..of</literal> loop.
Take this example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var arr1 = [ ["hello",1,2,3], ["goodbye",4,5,6] ];
for(var [head,...tail] of arr1) {
    console.log(head,'/',tail);

// will print:
//   hello / [ 1, 2, 3 ]
//   goodbye / [ 4, 5, 6 ]

var arr2 = [ {key:"hello", value:42}, {key:"goodbye", value:43} ];
for(var {key,value} of arr2) {
    console.log(key,'/',value);
}
// will print:
//   hello / 42
//   goodbye / 43</programlisting>
<simpara>Array and object destructuring pattern can appear in many different places:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>In a variable declaration (not just in variable statements but also in other places where variable declarations are allowed, e.g. plain for loops; called <emphasis>destructuring binding</emphasis>; see <xref linkend="_variable-statement"/>).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>On the left-hand side of an assignment expression (the assignment expression is then called <emphasis>destructuring assignment</emphasis>; see <xref linkend="_assignment-expression"/>).</simpara>

<simpara>In a <literal>for..in</literal> or <literal>for..of</literal> loop on the left side of the <literal>in</literal>/<literal>of</literal> (see <xref linkend="_for-of-statement"/>).</simpara>

<simpara>For further details on array and object destructuring please refer to the ECMAScript 6 specification - [<link linkend="ECMA15a">ECMA15a</link>].</simpara>
<simpara>Type annotations can only be added when a new variable name is introduced since the short version would be ambiguous with the long one.
For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var {x: someTypeOrNewVar} = ol</programlisting>
<simpara>could either mean that a new variable <literal>someTypeOrNewVar</literal> is declared and <literal>ol.x</literal> is assigned to it, or that a new variable <literal>x</literal> is declared with type <literal>someTypeOrNewVar</literal>.
The longer form would look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var {x: x: someType} = ol</programlisting>
<simpara>We can make this more readable:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var {propOfOl: newVar: typeOfNewVar} = ol</programlisting>

<simpara>This chapter describes <link linkend="_acronyms">DI</link> mechanisms for N4JS.
This includes compiler, validation and language extensions that allow to achieve DI mechanisms built in into the N4JS language and IDE.</simpara>
<simpara>N4JS <link linkend="_acronyms">DI</link> support specifies a means for obtaining objects in such a way as to maximize reusability, testability and maintainability,
especially compared to traditional approaches such as constructors, factories and service locators.
While this can be achieved manually (without tooling support) it is difficult for nontrivial applications.
The solutions that DI provides should empower N4JS users to achieve the above goals without the burden of maintaining so-called ’boilerplate’ code.</simpara>

DIC can be composed; meaning that when requested to inject an instance of a type, a DIC’s injector can delegate this request to the injector of the containing DIC.

<title>DIComponent Relations</title>
<simpara>A Parent-Child relation can be established between two DIComponents.
Child DIComponents use the parent bindings but can also be configured with their own bindings or <emphasis>change</emphasis> targets used by a parent.
The final circumstance is local to the child and is referred to as <emphasis>rebinding</emphasis>.
For more information about bindings see <xref linkend="_binders-and-bindings"/>.
A Child-Parent relation is expressed by the <literal>@WithParentInjector</literal> annotation attached to a given DIComponent.
When this relation is defined between DIComponents, the user needs to take care to preserve the proper relation between injectors.
In other words, the user must provide an instance of the parent injector (the injector of the DIComponent passes as a parameter to <literal>@WithParentInjector</literal>) when creating the child injector
(injector of the DIComponent annotated with <literal>@WithParentInjector</literal>).</simpara>

class ChildDIComponent{}

var childInjector = N4Inejctor.of(ChildDIComponent, parentInjector);</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>With complex DIComponent structures, injector instances can be created with a directly-declared parent and also with any of its children.

<simpara><emphasis>Binder</emphasis> allows an N4JS developer to (explicitly) define a set of <emphasis>Binding</emphasis>s that will be used by an <emphasis>Injector</emphasis> configured with a given <emphasis>Binder</emphasis>.
There are two ways for <emphasis>Binder</emphasis> to define <emphasis>Binding</emphasis>s: <literal>@Bind</literal> (<xref linkend="_n4js-di-bind"/>) annotations and a method annotated with <literal>@Provides</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Binder</emphasis> is declared by annotating a class with the <literal>@Binder</literal> annotation.</simpara>
<simpara>A <emphasis>Binding</emphasis> is part of a configuration that defines which instance of
what type should be injected into an <emphasis>injection point</emphasis> (<xref linkend="_injection-points"/>) with an expected type.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Provider Method</emphasis> is essentially a <emphasis>factory method</emphasis> that is used to create an instance of a type.
N4JS allows a developer to declare those methods (see <xref linkend="_n4js-di-provides"/>) which gives them a hook in instance creation process.
Those methods will be used when creating instances by the <emphasis>Injector</emphasis> configured with the corresponding <emphasis>Binder</emphasis>.
A provider method is a special kind of binding (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>y</mi></math>) in which the return type of the method is the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>y</mi></math>.
The <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></math> type is unknown at compile time (although it may be inferred by examining the return statements of the provide method).</simpara>

A <emphasis>binding</emphasis> is a pair <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mfenced close=")" open="("><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfenced></math>.
It defines that for a dependency with a given key which usually is the expected type at the injection point.
An instance of type <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></math> is injected.</simpara>
<simpara>A <emphasis>binding</emphasis> is called <emphasis>explicit</emphasis> if it is declared in the code, i.e. via <literal>@Bind</literal>
annotation or <literal>@Provides</literal> annotation).</simpara>
<simpara>A <emphasis>binding</emphasis> is called <emphasis>implicit</emphasis> if it is not declared.
An implicit binding can only be used if the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>y</mi></math> is a class and derived from the type at the injection point, i.e. the type of the field or parameter to be injected.
In that case, the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi></math> equals the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>y</mi></math>.</simpara>

<title>Constructor Injection</title>
<simpara>Parameters of the constructor can also be injected, in which case this is usually referred to as <emphasis>Constructor Inejction</emphasis>.
This is similar to <emphasis>Method Injection</emphasis> and while constructor injection is supported in N4JS, method injection is not (see remarks below).</simpara>
<simpara>When a constructor is annotated with <literal>@Inject</literal> annotation, all user-defined, non-generic types given as the parameters will be injected into the instance’s constructor created by the dependency injection framework.
Currently, optional constructor parameters are always initialized and created by the framework, therefore, they are ensured to be available at the constructor invocation time.
Unlike optional parameters, variadic parameters cannot be injected into a type’s constructor.
In case of annotating a constructor with <literal>@Inject</literal> that has variadic parameters, a validation error will be reported.
When a class’s constructor is annotated with <literal>@Inject</literal> annotation, it is highly recommended to annotate all explicitly-defined constructors at the subclass level.
If this is not done, the injection chain can break and runtime errors might occur due to undefined constructor parameters.
In the case of a possible broken injection chain due to missing <literal>@Inject</literal> annotations for any subclasses, a validation warning will
be reported.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_provider">
<title>Provider</title>
<simpara><emphasis>Provider</emphasis> is essentially a <emphasis>factory</emphasis> for a given type.
By injecting an <literal>N4Provider</literal> into any injection point, one can acquire new instances of a given type provided by the injected provider.
The providers prove useful when one has to solve re-injection issues since the depended type can be wired and injected via the provider rather than the dependency itself and can therefore obtain
new instances from it if required.
Provider can be also used as a means of delaying the instantiation time of a given type.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>N4Provider</literal> is a public generic built-in interface that is used to support the re-injection.
The generic type represents the dependent type that has to be obtained.
The <literal>N4Provider</literal> interface has one single public method: <literal>public T get()</literal> which should be invoked from the client code when a new instance of the dependent type is required.
Unlike any other unbound interfaces, the <literal>N4Provider</literal> can be injected without any explicit binding.</simpara>
<simpara>The following snippet demonstrates the usage of <literal>N4Provider</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class SomeService { }

@Singleton
class SomeSingletonService { }

class SomeClass {

    @Inject serviceProvider: N4Provider&lt;SomeService&gt;;
    @Inject singletonServiceProvider: N4Provider&lt;SomeSingletonService&gt;;

    void foo() {
        console.log(serviceProvider.get() ===

        console.log(singletonServiceProvider.get() ===
            singletonServiceProvider.get()); //true
    }

}</programlisting>
<simpara>It is important to note that the <literal>N4Provider</literal> interface can be extended by any user-defined interfaces and/or can be implemented by any user-defined classes.
For those user-defined providers, consider all binding-related rules; the extended interface, for example, must be explicitly bound via a binder to be injected.
The binding can be omitted only for the built-in <literal>N4Provider</literal>s.</simpara>

<simpara>Cycles stemming from field injection are resolved by halting the creation of new instances of types which have been already created by a containing instance.
The previously-created instance is then reused.
This makes injecting the instance of a (transitive) container less complicated and without the need to pass the container instance down the entire chain.
The following pseudo code describes the algorithm to create new instances which are injected into a newly created object:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">function injectDependencies(object) {
    doInjectionWithCylceAwareness(object, {(typeof object -&gt; object)})
}

function doInjectionWithCylceAwareness(object, createdInstancesPerType) {
    forall v $\in$ injectedVars of object {
        var type = retrieveBoundType(v)
        var instance = createdInstancesPerType.get(type)
        if (not exists instance) {
            instance = createInstance(type, createdInstancesPerType)
            doInjectionWithCylceAwareness(instance,
                createdInstancesPerType $\cap$ {(type-&gt;instance)})
        }
        v.value = instance;
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The actual instance is created in line 10 via <literal>createInstance</literal>.
This function then takes scopes into account.
The <literal>createdInstancesPerType</literal> map is passed to that function in order to enable cycle detection for constructor injection.
The following scopes are supported by the N4JS DI, other scopes, cf. <link xl:href="https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/ioc.html">Jersey custom scopes</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/CustomScopes">Guice custom scopes</link>, may be added in the future.</simpara>
<simpara>This algorithm is not working for constructor injection because it is possible to already access all fields of the arguments passed to the constructor.
In the algorithm, however, the instances may not be completely initialized.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_default-scope">
<title>Default Scope</title>
<simpara>The default scope always creates a new instance.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_singleton-scope">
<title>Singleton Scope</title>
<simpara>The singleton scope (per injector) creates one instance (of the type with <literal>@Singleton</literal> scope) per injector, which is then shared between clients.</simpara>
<simpara>The injector will preserve a single instance of the type of <literal>S</literal> and will provide it to all injection points where type of <literal>S</literal> is used.
Assuming nested injectors without any declared binding where the second parameter is <literal>S</literal>, the same preserved singleton instance will be available for all nested injectors at all injection points as well.</simpara>
<simpara>The singleton preservation behavior changes when explicit bindings are declared for type <literal>S</literal> on the nested injector level.
Let&#8217;s assume that the type <literal>S</literal> exists and the type is annotated with <literal>@Singleton</literal>.
Furthermore, there is a declared binding where the binding&#8217;s second argument is <literal>S</literal>.
In that case, unlike in other dependency injection frameworks, nested injectors may preserve a singleton for itself and all descendant injectors with <literal>@Bind</literal> annotation.
In this case, the preserved singleton at the child injector level will be a different instance than the one at the parent injectors.</simpara>
<simpara>The tables below depict the expected runtime behavior of singletons used at different injector levels.
Assume the following are injectors: <literal>C</literal>, <literal>D</literal>, <literal>E</literal>, <literal>F</literal> and <literal>G</literal>. Injector <literal>C</literal> is the top most injector and its nesting injector <literal>D</literal>, hence injector <literal>C</literal> is the parent of the injector <literal>D</literal>.
Injector <literal>D</literal> is nesting <literal>E</literal> and so on.
The most nested injector is <literal>G</literal>. Let&#8217;s assume <literal>J</literal> is an interface, class <literal>U</literal> implements interface <literal>J</literal> and class <literal>V</literal> extends class <literal>U</literal>.
Finally assume both <literal>U</literal> and <literal>V</literal> are annotated with <literal>@Singleton</literal> at definition-site.</simpara>
<simpara><xref linkend="tab:diNoBindings"/> depicts the singleton preservation for nested injectors without any bindings.
All injectors use the same instance from a type.
Type <literal>J</literal> is not available at all since it is not bound to any concrete implementation:</simpara>

<simpara><xref linkend="tab:diTransitiveBindings"/> is configured by explicit bindings. At the root injector level, type <literal>J</literal> is bound to type <literal>U</literal>.
Since the second argument of the binding is declared as a singleton at the definition-site,
this explicit binding implicitly ensures that the injector and all of its descendants preserve a singleton of the bound type <literal>U</literal>.
At injector level <literal>C</literal>, <literal>D</literal> and <literal>E</literal>, the same instance is used for type <literal>J</literal> which is type <literal>U</literal> at runtime.
At injector level <literal>E</literal> there is an additional binding from type <literal>U</literal> to type <literal>V</literal> that overrules the binding declared at the root injector level.
With this binding, each places where <literal>J</literal> is declared, type <literal>U</literal> is used at runtime.</simpara>
<simpara>Furthermore, since <literal>V</literal> is declared as a singleton, both injector <literal>F</literal> and <literal>G</literal> are using a shared singleton instance of type <literal>V</literal>.
Finally, for type <literal>V</literal>, injector <literal>C</literal>, <literal>D</literal> and <literal>E</literal> should use a separate instance of <literal>V</literal> other than injector level <literal>F</literal> and <literal>G</literal> because <literal>V</literal> is preserved at injector level <literal>F</literal> with the <literal>U</literal> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>→</mo></math> <literal>V</literal> binding.</simpara>

<title>Static Polyfill Definitions</title>
<simpara>Static polyfilling is a compile time feature to enrich the definition and usually also the implementation of generated code in N4JS. It is related to runtime polyfilling described in <xref linkend="_runtime-polyfill-definitions"/> in a sense that both fillings enrich the types they address. Despite this, static polyfilling and runtime polyfilling differ in the way they are handled.</simpara>
<simpara>Static polyfills usually provide executable implementations and are thus usually found in n4js files. However, they are allowed in n4jsd files, as well, for example to enrich generated code in an API project.</simpara>
<simpara>The motivation for static polyfills is to support automatic code generation.
In many cases, automatically generated code is missing some information to make it sufficiently usable in the desired environment.
Manual enhancements usually need to be applied.
If we think of a toolchain, the question may arise how to preserve the manual work when a
regeneration is triggered. Static polyfilling allows the separation of generated code and manual adjustments in separate files.
The transpiler merges the two files into a single transpiled file.
To enable this behaviour, the statically fillable types must be contained in a module annotated with <literal>@StaticPolyfillAware</literal>.
The filling types must also be annotated with <literal>@StaticPolyfill</literal> and be contained in a different module with same specifier but annotated with <literal>@StaticPolyfillModule</literal>.
Static polyfilling is restricted to a project, thus the module to be filled as well as the filling module must be contained in the same project.</simpara>
<simpara>We add a new pseudo property <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>l</mi></math> to classes in order to distinguish between normal (sub-) classes and static polyfill classes.
We add two new pseudo properties to modules in order to modify the transpilation process.

These types may be extensions to certain language specifications.
E.g., the ECMAScript 6 collection classes are already provided by some environments otherwise only supporting ECMAScript 5.
The collections are defined in terms of a runtime library which can then be provided by these environments.
Runtime libraries may also contain polyfils to alter types predefined in the environment.</simpara>

<title>Component Types</title>
<simpara>Different N4JS component types are described in this section.
At compile time and runtime, dependent components have to be available.
This is the responsibility of the user interface (<link linkend="AC">IDE</link> or <link linkend="AC">CLI</link>) and described in the <link linkend="AC">N4IDE</link> specification.</simpara>

<title>Libraries</title>
<simpara>A library is a user project providing modules with declaration.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_runtime-environment-and-runtime-libraries">
<title>Runtime Environment and Runtime Libraries</title>
<simpara>Runtime environments and libraries define globally available elements (types, variables, functions) provided by the JavaScript engine.
Both must contain <emphasis>only</emphasis> definition files (n4jsd) of which all elements are marked as <literal>@ProvidedByRuntime</literal> (<xref linkend="_runtime-definitions"/>) and <literal>@Global</literal> (<xref linkend="_global-definitions"/>).</simpara>
<simpara>Other projects may refer to <emphasis>multiple</emphasis> runtime libraries in their <literal>package.json</literal> file via the property <xref linkend="package-json-requiredRuntimeLibraries"/>.</simpara>
<simpara>The concrete runtime environment and library are selected by the JavaScript engine.
Deployment and execution scripts must ensure that a component can run on the given engine; the required environments and libraries must all be compatible with the provided environment.
If no runtime environment is specified, a default an ECMAScript 5 runtime is assumed to be present.</simpara>
<simpara>Typical runtime environments are ES5 or ES6, typical runtime libraries are DOM or HTML.</simpara>
<simpara>In JavaScript, browsers and other execution environments provide built-in objects.
In browsers, for example, the whole DOM is made available via built-in object types.
In this case, even the global object also becomes a different type (in N4JS terms).
Besides execution environments such as browsers or Node.js, libraries also provide functionality by exposing globally available functions.
This is often used to bridge execution environment inconsistencies.
When browser API differences are adapted by a library, this is called a <emphasis>polyfil</emphasis>.
Other adaptations, such as enabling ECMSScript 6 object types in ECMAScript 5 environments, are known as <emphasis>shim</emphasis>.
Instead of directly supporting these kind of 'hacks', other components specify which runtime environment and libraries they depend on by specifying unique runtime ids.
Possible shims (in case of environments) or polyfils (in case of libraries) are transparently provided by the execution environment and the bootstrap code.</simpara>

<simpara>Projects of type "definition" are special projects which only provide type information for another so-called <emphasis>implementation project</emphasis>,  which only provides executable JS files.</simpara>
<simpara>Generally, client projects that depend on a given <emphasis>implementation project</emphasis> may additionally declare a dependency on a corresponding type definitions project, in order to integrate type information on the implementation project.
This is implemented by means of module-level shadowing.
More specifically, given a client imports a module with module specifier <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>M</mi></math> from the implementation project.
When resolving the module specifier, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>M</mi></math> will first be resolved against the implementation project&#8217;s type definitions and only secondarily against the implementation project.
As a consequence, type definition projects may only provide partial type information, while the remaining modules of the implementation project remain accessible through dynamic namespace imports.</simpara>

<simpara>A component is similar to a project in the N4JS IDE. It consists of sources and test sources.
These items are contained in separate folders alongside output folders and settings specified in the <literal>package.json</literal> file.
The <literal>package.json</literal> file serves as the project description file and is stored at the root of the project (see <xref linkend="package-json"/> for details).</simpara>
<simpara>For build and production purposes, other files such as <literal>pom.xml</literal> or <literal>.project</literal> files are automatically derived from the <literal>package.json</literal>.

<simpara>A folder is a "component" if and only if it contains a <literal>package.json</literal> file. Being a component means
that this folder is recognized by all N4JS-related tools but does not necessarily mean the component
contains N4JS code (it could just contain plain Javascript). The main benefit of being a component
in this sense is that this unit of code can be used from N4JS components as a dependency.</simpara>

can therefore be used as a project dependency of a full-blown N4JS project.</simpara>

<simpara>(object) Defines various sub-folders where sources, etc. are located. All properties
of the given object must have to following format: the name must be "source", "external",
or "test"; the value must be an array of strings, with each string defining a
path relative to the component&#8217;s root folder, pointing to a folder where
source files of the corresponding type are located. For example, paths given via name
"source" tell the N4JS transpiler where to look for <literal>.n4js</literal> source files to be compiled.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>moduleFilters</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>(object) Filters for fine-tuning the validator and compiler. A filter is applied to modules
matching the given module specifier which may contain wildcards, optionally restricted to
modules defined in a specific source path.</simpara>
<simpara>All properties of the given object must have the following format: the name must be a valid
module filter type (see below); the value must be an array of strings, with each string
defining a pattern of files inside one of the source containers for which validation or
module wrapping is to be turned off. Instead of a plain string, the inner array may
contain an object with properties "module" and "sourceContainer" to make this filter apply
to only one of the source containers (instead of all source containers, which is the default).</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>noValidate</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Modules matching this filter are not semantically validated.
That is, they are still syntactically validated.

to declarations inside these modules.
Note that switching off validation for n4js files is disallowed.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>noModuleWrap</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Files matching this filter are not wrapped into modules and they are not semantically validated.
Since they are assumed to be wrapped into modules, declarations inside these modules cannot be referenced by n4js code.</simpara>

In N4JS, this is supported too.</simpara>
<simpara>Terminology:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>A project&#8217;s <emphasis>plain project name</emphasis> is its name without mentioning the project&#8217;s scope (if any),
e.g. <literal>myProject</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A project&#8217;s <emphasis>scope name</emphasis> is the name of the npm scope a project resides in, including a leading <literal>@</literal>.
E.g. <literal>@myScope</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A project&#8217;s <emphasis>N4JS project name</emphasis> is its plain project name, prefixed by its scope name (if any),
separated by a <literal>/</literal>. For unscoped projects, this is identical to the plain project name.
E.g., <literal>myProject</literal> (if unscoped), <literal>@myScope/myProject</literal> (if scoped).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A project&#8217;s <emphasis>Eclipse project name</emphasis> is an ancillary name used only within the Eclipse UI for
the project in the workspace. It is equal to the N4JS project name, except that <literal>:</literal> instead of <literal>/</literal> is
used as separator between the scope and plain project name.
E.g., <literal>myProject</literal> (if unscoped), <literal>@myScope:myProject</literal> (if scoped).</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>In case the intended meaning is apparent from the context, the "N4JS project name" can simply be referred to
as "project name" (as is common practice in the context of npm).</simpara>
<simpara>In N4JS, when importing from a module <literal>M</literal> contained in a scoped project <literal>@myScope/myProject</literal>, the import statement&#8217;s
module specifier should have one of the following forms:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>import * as N from "a/b/c/M";</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>import * as N from "@myScope/myProject/a/b/c/M";</literal></simpara>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Thus, the N4JS project name, which includes the scope name, is simply used in place of an ordinary, non-scoped
project&#8217;s name. This is in line with conventions in Javascript.</simpara>

<section xml:id="sec:N4JS-Type-Definitions">
<title>N4JS Type Definitions</title>
<simpara>N4JS projects can depend on ordinary JavaScript projects by including them in the package.json file.
From there on, modules of those JavaScript projects can be imported when writing N4JS code.
However, since JavaScript is untyped there will not be any type information for e.g. classes, functions
of ordinary JavaScript projects unless this type information is provided by a type definition project.
Type definition projects do only contain n4jsd files that reflect the classes and functions of a specific npm.
To refer to a JavaScript npm, the term <emphasis>plain-JS project</emphasis> will be used.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_specify-type-definition">
<title>Specify Type Definition</title>
<simpara>A type definition project is structured like a normal npm.
The major difference is that it provides n4jsd files instead of js files.
These n4jsd files are named like and located at the exact position in the file tree as their js-counterparts.
This ensures the type definition module and the corresponding plain-JS module to have the same fully-qualified name.
Besides the usual properties the package.json file usually needs to specify the following properties in the n4js section.</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Package.json: Important properties for type definition projects</title>
<para>
<screen>{
	"n4js": {
		"projectType": "definition"
		"definesPackage": "..."
		"mainModule": "..."
	}
}</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>
<simpara>The project type declares this project to be a type definition projects.
Consequently, it has to also declare the name for which plain-JS project its type definitions are provided (using <literal>definesPackage</literal>).
Lastly, the main module has to be specified since this information will not be taken from the package.json of the plain-JS project.
In case the plain-JS project does not have a main module or the main module is located at the package root,
the mainModule property can be omitted.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_name-conventions">
<title>Name Conventions</title>
<simpara>A type definition package can have an arbitrary name and define an arbitrary npm package.
This can be handy for testing purposes or just creating some temporary type definitions for a local package.
However, we chose to use a convention to simplify finding the right type definition package for a specific plain-JS project.
First, the scope <literal>@n4jsd</literal> and second the exact name of the plain-JS project is used.
For instance, when a user wants to install type definitions for the plain-JS project <literal>express</literal>,
our related type definitions are called <literal>@n4jsd/express</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_version-conventions">
<title>Version Conventions</title>
<simpara>Since the plain-JS project will evolve over time and publish different versions, the need arises to also
publish the type definition project in different versions that reflect this evolution.
In addition to the evolution of the plain-JS project, a new version of the type definition project can
also become necessary in case a bug in the type definitions was found or in case the language of N4JS changes
and the type definitions have to be adjusted accordingly.
Effectively, this will lead to a situation where both the implementation and the type definition project have
a version that are technically unrelated from an npm point of view, but still are somehow related to each other
from a semantical point of view.
To keep the distinct versioning of both of the projects manageable,
we propose the following conventions to partially align the type definition project&#8217;s version to that of the plain-JS project.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_define-a-new-type-definition-package">
<title>Define a New Type Definition Package</title>
<simpara>We use the following convention to compute the version of type definition packages.</simpara>
<simpara>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Major<subscript>types</subscript>.Minor<subscript>types</subscript>.Patch<subscript>types</subscript> = Major<subscript>impl</subscript>.Minor<subscript>impl</subscript>.0</simpara>
<simpara>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Major<subscript>types</subscript>.Minor<subscript>types</subscript>.Patch<subscript>types</subscript> = 3.3.0</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say that a new version of a type definition package called <emphasis>types</emphasis> should be created
that defines types for an npm called <emphasis>impl</emphasis> of version Major<subscript>impl</subscript>.Minor<subscript>impl</subscript>.Patch<subscript>impl</subscript>.
According to our convention, the major and minor version numbers of the type definition package
should just be copied from the version of the <emphasis>impl</emphasis> package.
However, the version patch number of <emphasis>types</emphasis> should not be taken from <emphasis>impl</emphasis>.
Instead, the patch number of <emphasis>types</emphasis> starts with <emphasis>0</emphasis> and increases with every update of this type definition version.
For instance when a bug was found in version Major<subscript>types</subscript>.Minor<subscript>types</subscript>.0, the definitions have been extended, or
adjusted to new language features, only the patch number increases to e.g. Major<subscript>types</subscript>.Minor<subscript>types</subscript>.1.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using-a-type-definition-package">
<title>Using a Type Definition Package</title>
<simpara>On the client side, a type definition package is listed among the dependency section.
Here we use the following convention to specify the required version of a type definition package.</simpara>
<simpara>"dependencies": {<?asciidoc-br?>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "@n4jsd/Types": "&lt;=Major<subscript>impl</subscript>.Minor<subscript>impl</subscript>.*"<?asciidoc-br?>
}</simpara>
<simpara>"dependencies": {<?asciidoc-br?>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "express": "^3.3.3",<?asciidoc-br?>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "@n4jsd/express": "&lt;=3.3.*"<?asciidoc-br?>
}</simpara>
<simpara>According to this convention, the major and minor version numbers of the implementation package are used,
prepended with a smaller-equals and appended with an asterisk for the patch number.
This also applies when the implementation version contains a tilde, a caret, etc., or is omitting a minor or patch number.
In case a non SemVer version is given (e.g. <literal>latest</literal>, empty string, url, etc.)
it is recommended to plain copy the non SemVer version when possible.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_rational">
<title>Rational</title>
<simpara>The rational behind this convention reflects the idea of semantic versioning:</simpara>
<blockquote>
<attribution>
<link xl:href="https://www.semver.org">semver.org</link>
</attribution>
<simpara>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</blockquote>
<simpara>Patch version increments are always backwards compatible according to SemVer.
In addition also no further functionality is added since this would imply at least an increment of the minor version.
Consequently, patch versions do not affect the interface or type information of an plain-JS project.
This is why patch version number fully suffices to reflect bug fixes and language changes for a given major.minor version.</simpara>
<simpara>On client side, we recommend to use a smaller-equals qualifier because most probably there will not be the exact version
of a requested type definition project.
Instead, only some major.minor versions will have a type definition counterpart.
Using a smaller-equals qualifier will make sure that a client will always get the latest version of a requested plain-JS project version.
In case a newer version of the plain-JS project was already published,
this convention guarantees that a compatible version of the type definition project is installed.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_api-and-implementation-components" role="language-n4js">
<title>API and Implementation Components</title>
<simpara>Instead of providing an implementation, N4JS components may only define an API by way of one or more n4jsd files which is then implemented by separate implementation projects.
For one such API project, several implementation projects may be provided.
Client code using the API will always be bound to the API project only, i.e. only the API project will appear in the client project’s <literal>package.json</literal> file under <literal>dependencies</literal>.
When launching the client code, the launcher will choose an appropriate implementation for each API project in the client code’s direct or indirect dependencies
and transparently replace the API project by the implementation project.
In other words, instead of the API project’s output folder, the implementation project’s output folder will be put on the class path.
Static compile time validations ensure that the implementation projects comply to their corresponding API project.</simpara>
<simpara>Note how this concept can be seen as an alternative way of providing the implementation for an n4jsd file: usually n4jsd files are used to define types
that are implemented in plain JavaScript code or provided by the runtime; this concept allows for providing the implementation of an n4jsd file in form of ordinary N4JS code.</simpara>
<simpara>At this time, the concept of API and implementation components is in a prototype phase and the tool support is limited.

<title>API and Implementation With DI</title>
<simpara>API projects may use N4JS DI (<xref linkend="_dependency-injection"/>) language features which require Implementation projects to provide DI-compatible behaviour
in order to allow a Client (implemented against an API project) to be executed with a given Implementation project.
This is essential for normal execution and for test execution.</simpara>

Together with structural typing, this allows N4JS to seamlessly integrate frameworks and libraries which have not been implemented in N4JS but in plain ECMAScript or another language.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_implementation-of-external-declarations">
<title>Implementation of External Declarations</title>
<simpara>All external declarations must be associated with an external implementation module in one way or another.
Any time the external declaration is imported, the compiler generates code that imports the corresponding implementation module at runtime.</simpara>
<simpara>There are two possible ways of linking an external declaration to its corresponding implementation:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>By naming convention defined in the <literal>package.json</literal> file.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>By declaring that the implementation is provided by the JavaScript runtime, see <xref linkend="_runtime-definitions"/> for details.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>The naming convention is based on the <literal>external</literal> source fragments defined in the <literal>package.json</literal> file (<xref linkend="package-json"/>).
If the implementation is provided by the runtime directly, then this can be also specified in the <literal>package.json</literal> file by a module filter.</simpara>
<simpara>The implicit link via the naming convention is used to link an external class declaration to its non-N4JS implementation module.
It does not effect validation, but only compilation and runtime.
Essentially, this makes the compiler generate code so that at runtime, the linked implementation module is imported instead of the declaration module.</simpara>
<simpara>In most use cases of external declarations you also want to disable validation and module wrapping by specifying appropriate filters in the <literal>package.json</literal> file.</simpara>
<simpara>Occasionally it is not possible for the validation to correctly detect a corresponding implementation element.
For that reason, it is possible to disable validation of implementations completely via <literal>@@IgnoreImplementation</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>Some elements are predefined by the JavaScript runtime such as DOM elements by the browser or built-in ECMAScript or non-standard objects.
These elements can be defined by means of external definitions; however, no actual implementation can be provided as these elements are actually provided by the runtime itself.</simpara>
<simpara>Since these cases are rather rare and in order to enable additional checks such as verification that a given runtime actually provides the elements,
this kind of element can only be defined in components of type runtime environment or runtime library (cf <xref linkend="_runtime-environment-and-runtime-libraries"/>).</simpara>

<title>Applying Polyfills</title>
<simpara>(Runtime) Libraries often do not provide completely new types but modify existing types.
The ECMA-402 Internationalization Standard [<link linkend="ECMA12a">ECMA12a</link>], for example, changes methods of the built-in class <literal>Date</literal> to be timezone-aware.
Other scenarios include new functionality provided by browsers which are not part of an official standard yet.
Even ECMAScript 6 [<link linkend="ECMA15a">ECMA15a</link>] extends the predecessor [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a</link>] in terms of new methods or new method parameters added to existing types.
It also adds completely new classes and features, of course.</simpara>
<simpara>The syntax of runtime polyfills is described in section <xref linkend="_polyfill-definitions"/>.
Here, an example of applying a runtime polyfill is detailed.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Object.observe with Polyfill</title>
<simpara>The following snippet demonstrates how to define a polyfill of the built-in class <literal>Object</literal> to add the new ECMAScript 7 observer functionality.
This snippet has to be defined in a runtime library or environment.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">@@ProvidedByRuntime
@@Global

@Polyfill
export external public class Object extends Object {
    public static Object observe(Object object, Function callback, Array&lt;string&gt;? accept);

}</programlisting>
<simpara>A client referring to this runtime library (or environment) can now access the observer methods as if it were defined directly in the original declaration of <literal>Object</literal>.</simpara>

.  Tag can be only used on either
..  methods annotated with <literal>@Test</literal>
..  classes in test projects or folders, cf. <xref linkend="jsdoc_tag__testeeFromType"/>.
.  Tag requires a single argument, which is a fully qualified name to a type, including the module specifier.
The format is as follows: <literal>moduleSpecifier '.' typeName ( ('.'|'#') memberName)?</literal>
.  Tag is <emphasis>not</emphasis> repeatable, that is a single test method (or class) can refer to only one testee.
.  Tag precedes the <literal>reqid</literal> tag, i.e., if a <literal>@testee</literal> is specified, the <literal>reqid</literal> will be ignored.</simpara>
</requirement>
<example>
<title>@testee</title>
<simpara>The target element is to be fully qualified including the module specifier. The module specifier is simply
the source folder relative path name with forward slashes. Type and
element are added to that using dot as a separator. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">/**
 * @testee some/package/Module.Type.member
 */</programlisting>
</example>
</section>
<section xml:id="jsdoc_tag__testeeFromType">
<title>@testeeFromType</title>
<simpara>Instead of directly linking a test method to a testee, the testee is to
be derived from the linked testee of the test class. This is useful if a
base test class is defined with generic tests, e.g., for testing methods
defined in an interface and implemented by some classes. This base test
class is then extended by concrete test classes, correctly setting up
the test fixture, e.g., creating instances of some classes implementing
the interfaces tested in the base class.</simpara>
<example>
<title>Usage of testeeFromType</title>
<simpara>In the following example, the is used. This tag will lead to a test documentation for <literal>B.foo</literal> and <literal>C.foo</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">abstract class Base {
    /**
     * @testeeFromType
     */
    @Test testFoo() {..}
}

/**
 * @testee B.foo
 */
class TestB extends Base {}

/**
 * @testee C.foo
 */
class TestC extends Base {}</programlisting>
</example>
<note>
<simpara>The resulting spec has to be double-checked for consistency
since it is easily possible that too many constraints are generated.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_testeeType_and__testeeMember">
<title>@testeeType and @testeeMember</title>
<simpara>Specifying the testee at the test method directly should be sufficient
for most cases. The <literal>@testeeFromType</literal> tag already provides support for some cases in which a base test class is reused by subtypes. This case usually only works if
the base test class tests a single method only. If the base test class
tests several methods and if a sub test class only provides a different
fixture, this mechanism is not sufficient. For that purpose, the two
tags <literal>@testeeFromType</literal> and <literal>@@testeeMember</literal> are to be used.
They enable the separation of a test related to a specific member and the concrete receiver type of the tested member.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>@testeeType</literal> is to defined in the test class JSDoc (actually, it is not
recognized when defined in a member JSDoc). The <literal>@testeeMember</literal> is specified in the test method JSDoc. The "real" testee is then computed from the testee type and the testee method.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>1. This only works for instance members, so far!<?asciidoc-br?>
2. There is no validation for invalid combinations!</simpara>
</note>
<example xml:id="ex:testeetype-and-testeemethod">
<title>testeeType and testeeMethod</title>
<simpara>Assume the following testees:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">class A {
    foo(): void {..}
    bar(): void { .. this.foo(); ..}
}
class B extends A {
    @Override foo() { .. }
}</programlisting>
</example>
<simpara>Assume that the tests have to ensure the same semantics for <literal>bar</literal>, which is
maybe changed by a wrong implementation of <literal>foo</literal>. That is, <literal>bar</literal> is to be tested in
case of the receiver type <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal>. This can be achieved by the following
tests:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">/**
 * @testeeType A.A
 */
class ATest {
    fixture(): A { return new A(); }

    /**
     * @testeeMember bar
     */
    @Test testBar(): void { assertBehavior( fixture().bar() ); }
}
/**
 * @testeeType B.B
 */
class BTest extends ATest {
    @Override fixture(): B { return new B(); }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This actually defines two tests, which is also recognized by the spec
exporter:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>testBar</literal> for a receiver of type <literal>A</literal>:</simpara>
<simpara><literal>ATest</literal>'s JSDoc <literal>@testeeType</literal> + <literal>ATest.testBar</literal>'s JSDoc <literal>@testeeMember</literal> = testee <literal>A.A.bar</literal></simpara>

</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<note>
<simpara>In all cases when <literal>@testeeFromType</literal> or <literal>@testeeType</literal>/<literal>@testeeMember</literal> is used, the resulting spec has to be
double-checked for consistency. Consider if the multiplication of spec
constraints is truly required, in particular if the original semantics
of a method is not changed. Remember: It is possible to write API tests
and omit the spec constraint generation simply by not adding the testee
links.</simpara>
</note>
<example>
<title>testeeType and testeeMethod with omitted constraints</title>
<simpara>Assume testees similar as in <xref linkend="ex:testeetype-and-testeemethod"/>. Since the semantics of <literal>bar</literal> is not changed in <literal>B</literal>, it is probably not necessary to generate the same constraint in the documentation for <literal>bar</literal> twice (one in the section for class <literal>A</literal> and another one in the section of class <literal>B</literal>).
Still, we want the test to be executed for both receivers. This is how it is achieved:</simpara>
<programlisting language="n4js" linenumbering="unnumbered">abstract class BaseTest {
    abstract fixture(): A;

    /**
     * @testeeMember bar
     */
    @Test testBar(): void { assertBehavior( fixture().bar() ); }
}

/**
 * @testeeType A.A
 */
class ATest extends BaseTest {
    fixture(): A { return new A(); }
}

class BTest extends BaseTest {
    @Override fixture(): B { return new B(); }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This actually defines two tests as in the previous example. Only one
constraint is created in the spec by the spec exporter:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>testBar</literal> for a receiver of type <literal>A</literal>:<?asciidoc-br?>
<literal>ATest</literal>'s JSDoc <literal>@testeeType</literal> + <literal>BaseTest.testBar</literal>'s JSDoc <literal>@testeeMember</literal> = testee <literal>A.A.bar</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Although a test for receiver of type <literal>B</literal> is run, no additional constraint is
created since there is no <literal>@testeeType</literal> available neither in <literal>BTest</literal> nor in <literal>BaseTest</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>The support for JSX in N4JS aims for an implementation that adheres to the idea of <link xl:href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">React JSX</link>. This means that JSX elements are transpiled to React Element factory calls (e.g. <literal>&lt;div prop="c"&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;</literal> transpiles to <literal>React.createElement('div', {prop: "c"}, null)</literal>). For that, the transpiler must be aware of a specific implementation of React and the corresponding <literal>createElement</literal> function.</simpara>

<simpara>N4JS extends the ECMAScript 2015 language grammar and combines it with type expression.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>These grammars are slightly simplified versions of the "real" Xtext grammars used in the implementation.
These grammars are post-processed and combined with additional validators so not all constructs are necessarily available in N4JS.</simpara>

<title>JSON</title>
<simpara><literal>JSON</literal> is a global object and a subclass of <literal>Object</literal>. Its functionality is provided by two static methods.
It is not possible to create new instances of type JSON.</simpara>
<bridgehead xml:id="attributes-5" renderas="sect3">Attributes</bridgehead>

<bridgehead xml:id="static-methods-8" renderas="sect3">Static Methods</bridgehead>
<simpara>The parse function parses a JSON text (a JSON-formatted String) and
produces an ECMAScript value. The JSON format is a restricted form of
ECMAScript literal. JSON objects are realized as ECMAScript objects.
JSON arrays are realized as ECMAScript arrays. JSON strings, numbers,
booleans, and null are realized as ECMAScript Strings, Numbers,
Booleans, and null. For detailed information see [<link linkend="ECMA11a">ECMA11a(p.S15.12.2)</link>]</simpara>
<simpara>The optional reviver parameter is a function that takes two parameters
(key and value). It can filter and transform the results. It is called
with each of the key/value pairs produced by the parse and its return
value is used instead of the original value. If it returns what it
received, the structure is not modified. If it returns then the property
is deleted from the result.</simpara>
<simpara>The stringify function returns a String in JSON format representing an
ECMAScript value. It can take three parameters. The first parameter is
required. The value parameter is an ECMAScript value which is usually an
object or array, although it can also be a String, Boolean, Number or
null.</simpara>
<simpara>The optional replacer parameter is either a function that alters the way
objects and arrays are stringified or an array of Strings and Numbers
that act as a white list for selecting the object properties that will
be stringified.</simpara>
<simpara>The optional space parameter is a String or Number that allows the
result to have whitespace injected into it to improve human readability.</simpara>

<simpara>Considering API definitions and concrete implementations of those APIs
the error <literal>N4-Api-Not-Implemented-Error</literal> is introduced to specifically report missing implementations.
Instances of this error type are inserted internally during the

will insert stub-code throwing an instance of <literal>N4-Api-Not-Implemented-Error</literal>.</simpara>
