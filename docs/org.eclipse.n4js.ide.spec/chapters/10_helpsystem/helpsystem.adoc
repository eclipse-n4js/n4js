== Hovering

Hovering over an element (such as type, field, method, function or variable declaration) in the N4JS editor will cause a tooltip appear containing information about the underlying element. Currently this information is the type (could be the inferred type as well), the name and the keyword (such as class, variable, field) of the actual element. By default the tooltip does not grab the focus from the currently active workbench window and will automatically disappear after the focus is lost from the element. One can grab the focus for the tooltip by clicking into the tooltip area or pressing kbd:[F2] function key.

=== Show Type Information of Selection

In some cases, during the development process, one would like to know what is the actual or even the inferred type of an N4JS expression. To use this functionality one can select the desired expression in the editor and invoke the ’Show Type Information’ command via the kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[Option]+ kbd:[I] ( kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Alt]+ kbd:[I] Windows/Linux) from the keyboard. This case a popup window will be raised containing the type information of the actual selection.
