= Assistance
:find:
:experimental:

In this chapter we describe all kind of tools assisting the user when writing code, i.e. content assist, quickfixes, quick assists, etc.

WARNING: Not all features are yet implemented!

[[sec:Content_Assist]]
[.language-n4js]
== Content Assist

Content assist may change the document at various places at once. In those cases, it is important to prevent flickering in the editor. The FQNImporter provides a blue print how to adjust line numbers properly and scroll the viewport of the current editor to minimize flickering in the UI.

Completions not listed here as they are provided by template proposals:

1.  Classifier declaration template proposal
2.  Function declaration template proposal
3.  Getter/Setter pair template proposal

[[sec:Complete_Keywords]]
===  Complete Keywords

Complete keyword which are syntactically correct at a given location. Do not suggest completions which would lead to wrong code.

Keywords that contain only a single character are not proposed since they would pollute the proposal window and don’t offer added value.

Special attention has to be given to operators. Since they are modelled in the grammar and not as cross references, their validaty is purely syntactically. That is, there is no generic facility in Xtext, that allows to filter unapplicable operators as there is for cross references.

[[sec:Complete_Annotations]]
===  Complete Annotations

Annotations can be proposed depending on the following elements or the context.

[[sec:Complete_Identifier_Reference]]
===  Complete Identifier Reference

References to identifiers can be automatically completed. This is even true if the declaration is not imported yet, as the import may be automatically added as well.

.Complete identifier references
--
The IDE supports auto-completion of an identifier referencing to a declaration.

1.  Complete type references.
2.  Complete function references.
3.  Complete variable references.
4.  Complete parameter references.
5.  If necessary, imports are added automatically to complete reference $r$ to declaration $D$.
+
Precondition::
-
Postcondition::
+
[%hardbreaks]
$              \spc bind(r, D) $
$              \spc \iff $
$              \spc r.name = D.name $
$              \spc D \in r.module $
$              \spc \lxor $
$              \spc \exists \texttt{NamedImportSpecifier} NIS: $
$              \spc WIS.importDecl.importedModule = D.module $
$              \spc  \lor \exists \texttt{WildcardImportSpecifier} WIS: $

Description::
  There might be multiple declarations $D$ in project (or in dependent projects) with $D.name=r.name$. If the declaration $D$ is not local, then a named import may be created by the content assist:

  ..  If the declaration $D$ is local, no import is created
  ..  If an import enabling access to the declaration already exists, no other import is created.
  ..  If an alias already exists, the alias name is used, even if the prefix was different when the content assist was activated.
  ..  If the import would conflict with an existing member, an alias is proposed along with the import. Linked editing helps to choose a proper alias.
  ..  All imports from a single module are done within a single import declaration. The exception to this rule are wildcard imports that provide a simple name which is currently unused. In that case, a new import may be necessary to disambiguate the wildcard.

6.  If the identifier reference refers to a function (or method), an opening and a closing parenthesis are appended and
    the cursor is positioned between these two parentheses.
--

[[sec:Complete_Member_Overrides]]
===  Complete Member Overrides

.Complete Member Overrides Inside a classifier
--
A prefix of an inherited member can be used to autocomplete that to a complete declaration.
This is in particular true for methods.
--

[[sec:Constructor_Completion]]
===  Constructor Completion

.Constructor Completion
--
Constructor Completion Based on the declared fields and super constructor, constructor methods can be completed.
--

[[sec:Complete_Function_Expression]]
===  Complete Function Expression with Known Type

.Complete Function Expression
--
If a function expression is used as an argument or assigned to a typed variable, the signature of the function can be derived from the type. This can be used to complete a function expression.
--

[[sec:Complete_Variable_and_Parameter_Names]]
===  Complete Variable and Parameter Names

.Type based completion of Variable and Parameter Names
--
Variable and parameter names can be completed based on the type. Camel case detection is used to propose different variations.
--

Completion of variables references see <<sec:Complete_Identifier_Reference,Complete Identifier Reference>>.

[[sec:Quick_Fixes]]
[.language-n4js]
== Quick Fixes

Quick fixes try to solve issues, i.e. errors or warnings, automatically. This is done by rewriting code, either at the location of the issue or at referenced locations.

In all cases, a quick fix must only be suggested if the following preconditions are fulfilled:

1.  All locations at which modifications have to be done must be writeable.
2.  If bindings are involved, e.g., names are to be changed, all previous bindings must remain similar. This might be more complicated as it seems!

[[sec:N4JS_Issue_Properties]]
=== N4JS Issue User data

As some quick fixes need more information to decide upfront which strategy to use, some issues provide additional data. These properties are defined in the file `IssueUserDataKeys.java` in the `org.eclipse.n4js.validation` package. They can for example be accessed by passing the according key to the `getUserData` method of an `N4JSIssue` instance. They are also available as array based Xtext Issue user data. +

All available user data keys are described for each Issue code in <<sec:N4JS_Issue_Fixes,N4JS Issue Fixes>>.

[[sec:N4JS_Issue_Fixes]]
=== N4JS Issue Fixes

The principle idea is to provide a quick fix for every issue, if it is possible to automatically solve it.

[[sec:Linking_Issues]]
====  Linking Issues

Linking issues are special in that they are created by the standard Xtext linker and use all the same built-in issue code `Diagnostic.LINKING_DIAGNOSTIC`. Therefore, we cannot refer to these issues using one of our custom N4JS issue codes.


Diagnostic.LINKING_DIAGNOSTIC::
``Couldn’t resolve reference to _n_``
.  Add missing import declaration for unresolved name _n_.
[horizontal]
Precondition::
..  An exported identifiable element _e_ with name _n_ exists in another module _m_.
..  _e_ is visible from the given location.
Label::
``Import _n_ - _m_``
Postcondition;;
An import declaration was added such that name _n_ is now resolvable at the given location and bound to _e_.
Description;;
Some important notes:
+
. `A` separate quick fix is proposed for each candidate element instead of having a single generic quick fix for adding imports and showing a dialog later (for example, create two quick fixes “Import class `X` from module M1" and “Import interface `X` from module M2" instead of a single quick fix “Add import for name X"). +
This is unusual for quick fixes, because it means significant work has to be done upfront when creating the quick fix / modification proposals, which raises performance concerns. However,
.. the JDT handles this the same way and
.. this brings the implementation closer to content assist allowing more reuse, therefore this decision was taken.
. For consistency, matching of lower/upper/camel case is to be handled as in code completion during content assist. The same applies to display string formatting, esp. name formatting and coloring of element _e_ and module _m_.
. Note that here we can make more assumptions than during import as part of content assist. For example, we know that the element is not imported yet (otherwise there would not be an error) and there won’t be a need for an alias and linked editing.

[[sec:Formatting]]

[[sec:Organize_Imports]]
===  Organize Imports

Import statements can be cleaned up or automatically inserted by invoking ``Organize Imports``. ``Organize Imports`` is available in the context menu ``Source / Organise imports`` , in menu ``Source > Organize imports`` or by hitting kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[Option] +kbd:[O] (Win/Linux - kbd:[Ctrl] +kbd:[Alt] +kbd:[O]).

For a valid file without errors, this will result in the following actions:

* Unused explicit imports will be removed.
* Unused wildcard imports will be removed.
* In each import statement the imported elements will be lexicographically sorted depending on the imported element’s name.
* All import statements will be lexicographically sorted depending on the module specifier as major and the element name as minor key.
* All import statements will be moved to the top of the file.

For a file with error-conditions of unresolved references, this will result in the automatic actions:

* All ambiguous wildcard imports will be presented in one dialog, requesting the user to resolve the ambiguity.
* Each uniquely resolvable ``unresolved Classifier`` will be added by a named import. The search scope is limited to the dependencies declared in the current project-setup.

No action will be taken, if ...

* a classifier with name `X` is already imported by name from a module `A` and a unknown member of this classifier is marked. Even though the import of `X` from a different module `B` could remove this error, the semantic consequences could not be evaluated. The state will be left as-is.

If more then one option leads to a possible resolution the situation should be clarified using quick-fixes, e.g. if ...

* more then one module provides an element, which would render a formerly unresolved reference to be valid.
* for a wildcard-imported element `X` there are unknown members and a different module provides an element `X` containing the missing members. In such a case a named import of `X` would be proposed, optionally using an alias.
